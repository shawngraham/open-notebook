# The Web of Authors for Wikipedia's Archaeology Page

I'm playing with a new toy, [WikiImporter](https://wikiimporter.codeplex.com/), which allows me to download the network of authorship on media-wiki powered sites. I fired it up, set it to grab the user-article network and "The **Hyperlink Coauthorship** network will analyze all the links found in the _seed article_ and create an edge between each user that edited the article found in that link and the article". Naturally, I pointed it at 'archaeology' on Wikipedia.  I've posted the r[esulting two mode network on figshare](http://figshare.com/articles/Hyperlink_Coauthorship_User_Article_Network_from_Wikipedia_Archaeology_article/1008152) for all and sundry to analyze. I also asked it to download the article to article links (which is slightly different than my spidering results, as my spiders also included the wiki pages themselves, like the 'this page is a stub' or 'this page needs citations', which gives me an interesting perspective on the _quality_ of the articles. More on that another day). This file[ is also on figshare here.](http://figshare.com/articles/Article_to_article_network_via_hyperlinks_from_Wikipedia_Archaeology_page/1008153) Just remember to cite the files. Enjoy!
