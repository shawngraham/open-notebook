# Pleiades Responds

My attempt at pumping Pleiades through yahoo pipes led to an interesting discussion with Tom Elliott, the direct of the Pleiades project. Tom writes 

> As Shawn observed, pumping that list of ancient names through a presentist geocoder (like Yahoo!'s) gives you suboptimal results. [Pleiades](http://pleiades.stoa.org/) in fact stores locations for every feature (at least when we can determine their locations). In our customization work on Plone for Pleiades, we've tacked on a couple of other interfaces that aren't as obvious to users as they should be. Anywhere Pleiades displays or lists spatial content, we also provide an [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29) feed that's extended with [GeoRSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoRSS) tags, as well as a [KML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) feed. So, for those archaic places, Shawn could choose to use either of: 
> 
>   * <http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/archaic/atom>
>   * <http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/archaic/kml>
>
>> Both provide the coordinates, and therefore get you around the geocoding problem.

The full text of Tom's post is [here](http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2007/09/feeds-for-pleiades-data.html). Thanks Tom! I'm going to see what I can do with those new feeds...

## Comments

**[Shawn](#95 "2007-10-10 14:08:49"):** Using Tom's suggestions, I've added distinct feeds for each period of Pleiades place data. It works - but I'm intensely frustrated with Pipes today, since every time I add a feed or otherwise alter the pipe, the whole site crashes on me. What good is that? C'mon Yahoo... Anyway, Pleiades Project Pipe lives [ here ](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=yrJW8DZt3BG6JCHWTqoASA).
