# Horizon 2009 Report

If you're not familiar with the [Horizon Reports](http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2009/) from [NMC](http://wp.nmc.org/), then you should take a moment to page through it. The Horizon Reports 

> __ describe the continuing work of the New Media Consortium (NMC)’s Horizon Project, a long-running qualitative research project that seeks to identify and describe emerging technologies likely to have a large impact on teaching, learning, research, or creative expression within learning-focused organizations.

The report includes numerous links and examples of emerging projects that really push the boundaries.  Two items that caught my eye - my thinking being these would be immediately applicable to archaeology - were the sections on 'mobiles' and 'geo-coded everything'. Some examples already in the pipeline: 

> **Mobile MaaP** <http://maap.columbia.edu/m/index.html> Columbia University’s Mapping the African American Past (MAAP) website now includes a mobile version designed to be viewed using the iPhone or iPod Touch. The tool includes text and audio information about historically significant locations in New York City and is designed as a tool for mobile learning.

One could imagine using this kind of application to pre-load all sorts of archaeological landscape information, historic sites, and so on - an augmented reality. 

> **TinyEye Music**, **Snap-Tell** TinEye Music (http:// www.ideeinc.com/products/tineyemobile/) and Snap-Tell (<http://snaptell.com/>) use the camera to record a photograph of a CD, video, or book, then identify the artist or author and display that along with reviews of the piece and information on where to buy it

When I was in the business of identifying Roman brick stamp types, I had a reverse-lookup dictionary on my lap and an equipoise lamp, trying to read the letters, trying to figure out what the **** I was looking at. These two apps could serve as models for us, to tie our catalogues of stamps, forms, fabrics and so on, to our phones. Snap! 'Vernice Nera ware'... Snap! 'CIL XV.1 861a' On the Geocoding front: 

> Collage (<http://tapulous.com/collage/>), a photo application for the iPhone, lets the viewer upload geotagged photos, browse photos taken nearby, and see photos as they are taken all over the world. Mobile Fotos (<http://xk72.com/mobilefotos/>) is another iPhone application that automatically geotags photos taken on the device before uploading them to Flickr.

Obvious usefulness when you have the right device! But if you don't: 

> The [Photo Finder by ATP Electronics](http://photofinder.atpinc.com/) and the [Nikon GP-1](http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Photography-Accessories/Miscellaneous/25396/GP-1-GPS-Unit.html) are examples; they capture GPS data and synchronize it to a camera’s data card to geotag the photos automatically. Another approach is to use a specialized device like the GPS Trackstick ([http://www.gpstrackstick.com](http://www.gpstrackstick.com/)) that can be carried in a pocket or glove box. It records the path it travels, and the data can be uploaded to create custom maps of walking or driving routes, hiking trails, or points of interest. Geotagging of media of all kinds is increasingly easy to do (or is automatic), and as a result, the amount and variety of geotagged information available online is growing by the day.

And something I'd never heard of, but looks promising: 

> Virtual [geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/) — the practice of placing media (images, video, audio, text, or any kind of digital files) in an online “drop box” and tagging it with a specific geographic location — is emerging as a way to “annotate” real-world places for travelers or tourists; enhance scavenger hunts, alternate reality games, and other forms of urban outdoor recreation; and augment social events such as concerts and other performances. Drop.io Location (<http://drop.io/dropiolocation>) is one such service. Mobile users can detect the location of nearby drops and retrieve any files they have permission to access.

Some other items: 

> **Geocoding with Google Spreadsheets (and Gadgets)** <http://otherfancystuff.blogspot.com/2008/11/geocoding-with-google-spreadsheets-and.html> _(Pamela Fox, …And Other Fancy Stuff, 27 November 2008.)_ This blog post includes step- by-step instructions for embedding a gadget, created by the author, that plots addresses from a Google spreadsheet on a map, providing latitude and longitude data that can be used in other mashups. **The Mapas Project** <http://whp.uoregon.edu/mapas/AGN/Guelaxe/fullview.shtml> The fledgling Mapas Project at the University of Oregon is dedicated to the study of Colonial Mexican pictorial manuscripts. Geolocation is being used to link real-world locations to those represented on the maps.

This next one I've written about before, but it's worth keeping your eye on as it develops: 

> **Mediascape** <http://www.mscapers.com/> Mediascape is a tool for creating interactive stories that unfold as the viewer moves through physical space and time. By tapping into the GPS on a viewer’s mobile device and incorporating multimedia as well as interactive controls, every mediascape offers a unique experience for each viewer.

I find it very interesting that so many of these emerging approaches focus on merging historical data with geographical data. Public History and Public Archaeology: the next big things! 

> **Next Exit History** <http://nextexithistory.org/> Next Exit History is a project by the University of West Florida and the University of South Florida designed to provide geotagged information (podcasts and other media) to assist tourists in finding and learning about historical sites in Florida that are near major interstate highways but often overlooked by visitors. **How Your Location-Aware iPhone will Change Your Life** <http://lifehacker.com/395171/how-your-location+aware-iphone-will-change-your-life> _(Adam Pash, Lifehacker, 5 June 2008.)_ The iPhone’s location-aware features enhance a host of applications from social networking tools to geotagging photos taken by the phone to nearby restaurant recommendations. **Delicious: Geo-Everything** <http://delicious.com/tag/hz09+geolocation> _(Tagged by Horizon Advisory Board and friends, 2008.)_ Follow this link to find resources tagged for this topic and this edition of the Horizon Report, including the ones listed here. To add to this list, simply tag resources with “hz09” and “geolocation” when you save them to Delicious.

And to close, I'll admit a degree of ignorance about the semantic side of weblife, but that section should also be of interest -

## Comments

**[samarkeolog](#2044 "2009-05-22 08:24:08"):** I'm not techy enough to know whether this is a potentially good idea or whether it has no relation to scientific possibility whatsoever, but could there be an [illicit antiquities database-TinEye mash-up](http://human-rights-archaeology.blogspot.com/2009/05/illicit-antiquities-tineye-mash-up.html) to identify and impede online illicit antiquities trading?

**[Minty](#1836 "2009-02-06 12:55:36"):** nice blog
