# Learning 2.0 - interview with Garrison & Vaughan

From '[Inside Higher Ed](http://insidehighered.com/news)', a short interview with Randy Garrison and Norman Vaughan, authors of 'Blended Learning in Higher Education: Framework, Principles, and Guidelines': 

>  "As online tools become more ubiquitous inside and outside the classroom, and the growth of distance learning continues, education researchers have begun to focus on how best to harness new technologies. Advocates for the classical lecture experience still exist, of course, but the general trend has been toward incorporating various technologies into the classroom, from course management software to digital photography. One approach, called “blended learning,” mixes traditional “face to face” techniques with cutting-edge developments in theory and technology. A new book, _[Blended Learning in Higher Education: Framework, Principles, and Guidelines_](http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0787987700.html)_ _(Wiley, 2008), summarizes the current theory behind blended learning but offers practical guidelines (with examples) on how to transform existing courses into the new framework. The authors, [D. Randy Garrison](http://commons.ucalgary.ca/information/directory/dr_randy_garrison) and [Norman D. Vaughan](http://www.ucalgary.ca/%7Envaughan/), of the University of Calgary, discuss the ideal conditions for a blended learning experience, how a blog and a wiki can enhance a class and how exclusively face-to-face encounters can lead to short attention spans.<[more>](http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/11/13/blended)"
