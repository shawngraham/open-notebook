# PatronWorld - Digital Death for Artificial Romans

One long term project is finally nearing publication - my artificial society of Romans who pay respects one to another (the morning 'salutatio': the process of visibily re-affirming patronage links). In the model, a theory of civil violence in the Roman world is articulated, as an outcome of patronage or its failure (I use to have a 'smite!' button and could kill the digital Romans at will, but that was obviously unsatisfactory). The model lives [here](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~grahams/PatronWorld.html).  Below the model on that page are excerpts from the paper describing what the model does, and an ever so brief rationale for why it does these things - you'll have to wait for the formal publication for why any of this matters! It's currently under review, so I made the model public in order for  the reviewer to be able to delve into the code if he or she so desires.  Simulations are arguments-in-code, as Ian Bogost tells us, so the rhetoric of my code needs to be evaluated as much as the rhetoric of my article.

## Comments

**[Shawn](#1841 "2009-02-12 07:49:28"):** The answer to 'When on Google Earth #1' was indeed Persepolis; however it is a quirk of the current theme that I am using, that the comments for a post are accessed by the post title - click through there and you'll be able to find the trail to subsequent 'When on Google Earth's! - most recent lives [here](http://ancientworldbloggers.blogspot.com/2009/02/when-on-google-earth-no-4.html).

**[ro.p.](#1840 "2009-02-11 19:46:13"):** Surely it is Persepolis

**[Lars Anderson](#1826 "2009-02-02 12:23:54"):** Persepolis in Iran, roughly 500 to 300 BCE?
