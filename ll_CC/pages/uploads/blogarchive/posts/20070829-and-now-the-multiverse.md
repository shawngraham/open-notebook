# ....and now, the Multiverse!

Some people I talk to about virtual worlds get nervous at the thought that a place like Second Life is owned by a for-profit company. The way I see it, allowing somebody else to handle the infrastructure is a positive bonus, but for the committed DIY-er, there is now the opportunity to build and host your own online world, courtesy of the tools created by [Multiverse](http://multiverse.net/). As I write, I am awaiting the patcher to finish loading up, so that I may enter the Dark Horizons Universe...
