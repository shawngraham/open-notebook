# Digital Digging, a new version of Google Earth, and Mycosm

A new version of [Google Earth ](http://earth.google.com/)is out, featuring: 

> * Photo-realistic buildings from cities around the world
> * Dawn to dusk views with the Sunlight feature
> * Swoop navigation from outer space to street-level

Henry points me to [Digital Digging](http://www.digitaldigging.co.uk/index.html), where they've got some fantastic [sketch-up](http://www.sketchup.com/) models of archaeological sites imported into Google earth. They've got a great site going on, with lots of material on one of the most famous of counties (at least archaeologically-wise!) in England - Wiltshire. The movie below is a reconstruction of the sanctuary at Avebury: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czp3in8a_Sg] A site (both web & archaeological) well worth exploring! On a related note, a new virtual world called '[Mycosm](http://mycosm.com/)' promises to allow users to import Sketchup models to make the world their own. If that works well, it'll be a jump on [Second Life](http://secondlife.com)... I've never had a more frustrating time than trying to make things in SL!

Indeed Mycosm will allow you to import SketchUp models via 3DS export and populate your own virtual world with them, they can also be published to the community if you so choose. We are looking at native format SketchUp model import as well. Regards, Ben ( [ )

**[Henry](#877 "2008-04-17 20:02:02"):** Hi Shawn - I'd also like to thank you for the mention. Mycosm is looking pretty exciting. Ben! The Sketchup import feature is good news - I heard Google did a deal with Multiverse so you could import geospatial data from Google Earth - I don't suppose there's something similar in the pipeline for Mycosm is there? (If you can't speak about it for any reason, just nod or wink) Best wishes to the both of you, Henry.
