# Government of Canada Edits

In recent days, a number of [twitterbots](https://github.com/edsu/anon) have been set up to monitor changes to Wikipedia emerging from government IP address blocks. Seems to me that here is a window for data mining the mindset of government. Of course, there's nothing to indicate that anything untoward is being done by the Government itself; I live in Ottawa, and I know [what civil servants can get up to on their lunch break](http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/government-right-to-fire-civil-servant-for-abusing-internet-privacy-breach-tribunal). But let's look at the recent changes documented by https://twitter.com/gccaedits![](https://twitter.com/gccaedits); I've taken screenshots below, but you can just scroll through gccaedits' feed. Actually, come to think of it, someone should be archiving those tweets, too. It's only been operational for something like 3 days, but already, we see an interesting grammar/football fanatic; someone with opinions on Amanda Knox; someone setting military history right, and someone fixing the German version of Rene Levesque's page. Hmmm. Keep your eyes on this, especially as next year is an election year... ![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.54.49 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-54-49-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.54.24 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-54-24-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.54.03 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-54-03-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.53.35 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-53-35-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.53.14 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-53-14-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.52.55 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-52-55-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.52.23 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-52-23-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.51.52 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-51-52-pm.png?w=300)![Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 1.55.06 PM](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-14-at-1-55-06-pm.png?w=300)
