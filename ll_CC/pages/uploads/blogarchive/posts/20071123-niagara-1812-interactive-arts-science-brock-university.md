# Niagara 1812 - Interactive Arts & Science, Brock University

The class projects from this year's crop of students in the Interactive Arts & Science program at Brock University are now online... full details [here](http://www.brocku.ca/iasc/niagara1812/). The theme is 'Niagara 1812', when the Niagara peninsula (location of Brock University, no coincidence) was the flashpoint for hostilities between the young American republic and Great Britain. Lundy's Lane, Queenston Heights: famous battles every Canadian should know! The projects are very impressive. They come in a variety of flavours - flash, 3d, a mix of text & bird's-eye battle... the games are aimed at the secondary school level, and each game's website comes with suggestions for student or teacher use. Well done!
