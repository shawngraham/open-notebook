# How to make an augmented reality pop-up book

![](https://p.twimg.com/ArvSl8aCAAA139G.jpg:large)We made an [augmented reality pop-up book in my first year seminar ](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/05/04/mesoamerica-in-gatineau-augmented-reality-museum-catalogue-pop-up-book/)last spring. Perhaps you'd like to make your own? 1\. Go to [Junaio ](http://www.junaio.com/)and register as a [developer](http://www.junaio.com/develop/). 2\. Get some server space that meets Junaio's requirements. 3\. On the right hand side of the screen, when you're logged into Junaio, you can find out what your API key is by clicking on 'show my api'. You'll need this info. 4\. Create a channel (which you do once you're logged in over at Junaio; click on 'new channel' on the right hand side of the screen). You will need to fill in some information. For the purposes of creating a pop-up book, you select a 'GLUE channel'. The 'callback' is the URL of the folder on your server where you're going to put all of your assets. Make this 'YOURDOMAIN/html/index.php. Don't worry that the folder 'html' or the file 'index.php' doesn't exist yet. You'll create those in step 6. Now the fun begins. I'm going to assume for the moment that you've got some 3d models available that you'll be using to augment the printed page. These need to be in .obj format, and they need to be smaller than >750 kb. I've used [123D Catch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch) to make my models, and then [Meshlab ](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/)to reduce the size of the models ([Quadratic Edge Collapse](http://www.shapeways.com/tutorials/polygon_reduction_with_meshlab) is the filter I use for that). Make sure you keep a copy of the original texture somewhere so that it doesn't get reduced when you reduce polygons. 5\. Create your tracking images. You use[ Junaio's tool to do this](http://dev.junaio.com/tools/trackingxmlcreator). At the bottom of that page, where it says, 'how many patterns do you want to generate?', select however many images you're going to augment. PNGs should work; make sure that they are around 100 kb or smaller. If your images don't load into the tool - if it seems to get stuck in a neverending loading cycle - your images may be too large or in the wrong format.  Once this process is done, you'll download a file called 'tracking.xml_enc. Keep this. 6\. Now, at this point, things are a bit different than they were in May, as Junaio changed their API somewhat. The old code still works, and that's what I'm working with here. Here's the [original tutorial from Junaio](http://www.junaio.com/develop/quickstart/tutorials/glue-quickstart/glu-001-hello-glue/). Download the ['Getting Started' php package](http://dev.junaio.com/publisherDownload/GettingStarted.zip). Unzip it, and put its contents into your server space. 7\. navigate to config/config.php, open that, and put your Junaio Developer key in there. 8\. I created a folder called 'resources'; this is where you're going to put your assets. Put the tracking_xml.enc in there. 9\. Navigate to src/search.php. Open this. This is the file that does all the magic, that ties your tracking images to your resources. Here's mine, for our book. Note how there's a mixture of movies and models in there:
