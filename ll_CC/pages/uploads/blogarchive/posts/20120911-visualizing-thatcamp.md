# Visualizing THATCamp

![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thatcamp2012.png?w=300)[THATCamps](http://thatcamp.org) are quite popular. [I'm throwing one myself](http://accessibility2012.thatcamp.org/). But who are the people talking about them on Twitter? What does the THATCamp look like on the Twitterverse? I used [NodeXL ](http://nodexl.codeplex.com/)to retrieve the data - a search for tweets, people, and the links between them. I then visualized the data in [Gephi](http://gephi.org), where colour = community (per Gephi's modularity routine) and sized the nodes (individual Twitterers) using Pagerank, on the premise that this was a directed graph and one should follow the links (although there was little difference with Betweeness Centrality. Major players are still major, either way). I found 233 individuals, linked together by 4435 edges. Some general stats on this directed network:

And now the visualization. You can [download the zoomable pdf here. ](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/thatcamp-sept11-20122.pdf) As I look at the modularity in this graph, at first blush, you can see quite a North America / European divide, with various satellite outposts. This could be of course because there's a THATCamp Paris coming down the pipe (lots of French in the tweets).

## Comments

**[Shawn](#8086 "2012-10-19 12:56:29"):** Hi Rena, I'm glad your project is progressing, and that this visualization is helpful. Please do sign up for THATCamp. It costs nothing and might make a nice break from writing the application :)

**[renabivens](#8085 "2012-10-19 12:52:35"):** This is great and has sparked an idea for me while I'm still in the process of putting together this new research proposal I came to talk to you about. I'm thinking I can search for hashtags popular in the gender-based violence movement (#VAW instantly comes to mind as an example) and then get a quick visualization of some of the major players in the movement. Thanks Shawn! My project has developed enormously since I spoke with you last. I'm hoping to come to THATCamp although it is the weekend before this application is due so I haven't signed up yet just in case I am still just as crazy busy as I am now. Hope all is well!
