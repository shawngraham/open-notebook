# XRD results of British School at Rome stamped bricks

It occurred to me, after reading the discussion at [Ancient World Bloggers](http://ancientworldbloggers.blogspot.com/2008/04/drills-small-and-large-animals-sharing.html) about data sharing, that I had some data that - while available in some libraries - might be usefully put up on this blog. I imagine perhaps an introductory archaeological stats course might find it handy, or perhaps some lone worker on Roman stamped brick might need some comparanda. For what I did with this data, see my[ 2006 BAR volume, chapter 3](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/publications-conferences/). Incidentally, my findings with this data (from my 2002 thesis, published in 2006), fits nicely with Elisabetta Gliozzo's findings published in ['The Distribution of bricks and tiles in the Tiber valley: the evidence from Piammiano' Supplying Rome and the Empire, JRA S.69, 2004. ](http://www.journalofromanarch.com/s69.pdf) Appendix B: XRD Peak Heights above Background for Tested SES Bricks For mineral peaks selected and the methodology to convert peak heights (measured in mm) to semi-quantified relative amounts of minerals, see 3.3
