# Interview on 'Voices of the Past'

I was interviewed about my digital work recently for '[Voices of the Past'](http://www.voicesofthepast.org/); the interview was just published [here](http://www.voicesofthepast.org/2010/02/12/meet-the-blogger-electric-archaeologys-shawn-graham-on-simulating-ancient-social-networks/). Enjoy!
