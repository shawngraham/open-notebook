# Most viewed Electric Archaeology posts

The statistics function of the wordpress interface is quite useful. Here, for curiosity's sake, are the all-time most viewed posts in this blog, with _>_ 50 views. Clearly, games & simulations attract the most attention. The single most-viewed was my 'about page', and 'publications' ranked up there too, but I expunged them from this list (for no better reason than I felt they didn't really belong here). January 08 has been my best month to date, with nearly 2200 distinct views; each month has been better than the previous one.Â  This heartens my soul and makes me feel like I'm a contributing member to the discipline ;). Thanks!
