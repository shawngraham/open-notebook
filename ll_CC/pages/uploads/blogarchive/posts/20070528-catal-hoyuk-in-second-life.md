# Catal Hoyuk in Second Life

Ah, I so wanted to come up with this idea, and make it happen![Constructing Knowledge & Virtual Places « Open Knowledge and the Public Interest](http://okapi.wordpress.com/2007/04/07/constructing-knowledge-virtual-places/) From 'Remixing Catal Hoyuk': 

> > We will work closely with Anthropology professor Ruth Tringham to construct a teaching collection from her vast archive of research materials documenting the remains of a 9000 year-old Neolithic human settlement located in modern-day Turkey. Remixing Çatalhöyük will feature themed collections and an archive of student “remixes.” This resource will serve as a national model for inquiry-based teaching and engaging students and campus scholars in outreach and education efforts.

> "Over the next several months, Marc Moglen and Daniel Wei, two undergraduate research apprentices will use Okapi island to develop a 3d model and virtual tour of [Çatalhöyük](http://catalhoyuk.com/), the site of a an archaeological excavation of a 9000 year-old human settlement located in modern-day Turkey. Working closely with the Remixing Catalhoyuk team, they will explore new ways of representing and interacting with archaeological data. Marc and Daniel will share progress on this project via regular blog updates."
