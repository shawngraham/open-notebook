# Draft: Natural Resource Extraction and the Roman Bazaar: An Agent Based Exploratory Lab

![Screenshot from the model](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/romanbazaar.png?w=300)What follows is a draft of an article I've submitted to a journal. If two blind reviews are good, more must be better, right? Keep in mind this could get rejected or substantially altered from its final version. *** This paper outlines how agent-based modeling can be used as a laboratory for exploring aspects of ancient economic life. Bang (2006; 2008) has put forth a model of the Roman economy developed from the insights of Clifford Geertz (1979) as an ‘imperial bazaar’. A significant portion of Bang’s model hinges on social networks. Particular network topologies have implications for the flows of materials or ideas through them, and so knowing the kind of network shapes that the ‘bazaar’ might generate should be explored. We can develop an agent based simulation of Bang’s model which as a by-product of its functioning generates social networks. We can then look at under what conditions the generated social network matches social networks known archaeologically from the extractive economy of Roman brick and tile. The simulation thus represents a way of bridging economic theory with the archaeological evidence. Suggestions for extending the model to explore multiple kinds of products and adapting it are presented. **Keywords** Agent based modeling; Roman economic history; simulation; trade, natural resources **Introduction** This paper explores what the economist Lea Tesfatsion calls ‘agent-based computational economics’ (2012). It uses the Netlogo (Wilensky, 1999) agent based modeling platform to implement a (necessarily) simplified Roman economy. The model generates social networks which can then be measured against known archaeological networks; where there is a degree of congruence, I argue that the model has generated new knowledge. In this regard, what I am building is a ‘computational laboratory’ that takes place in an explicitly spatial environment (Dibble, 2006). In the spirit of open access, I make the model and its code available for experimentation and extension and so the results presented here should be seen as necessarily preliminary. According to Peter Bang, the Roman economic system is best understood as a complex, agrarian tributary empire, of a kind similar to the Ottoman or Mughal (Bang 2006; 2008). In such states, trade and markets remained locally and regionally fragmented (though there could be overlapping ‘regions’ of different sizes, depending on the product; cf Horden and Purcell 2000: 123-72 on ‘connectivity of microregions’). This was a ‘stable’ economic state, with its own characteristics and patterns. Bang (2006: 72-9) draws attention to the concept of the _bazaar_. The bazaar was a complete social system that incorporated the small peddler with larger merchants, long distance trade, with a smearing of categories of role and scale. “The bazaar was notorious as a place of high risk and uncertainty where bottlenecks, asymmetries and imbalances were endemic… Bazaar can be used to denote a stable and complex business environment characterised by uncertainty, unpredictability and local segmentation of markets.” (79) The bazaar emerged from the interplay of instability and fragmentation. The mechanisms developed to cope with these reproduced that same instability and fragmentation. Bang identifies four key mechanisms that did this: small parcels of capital (to combat risk, cf Skydsgaard 1976); little homogenization of products (agricultural output and quality varied year by year, and region by region as Pliny discusses in _Naturalis Historia_ 12 and 18); opportunism; and social networks (80-4). As Bang demonstrates, these characteristics correspond well with the archaeology of the Roman economy and the picture we know from legal and other text. Bang concludes, “…the set of strategies outlined here provided a complex and resistant foundation for trade. But the result was to consolidate tendencies towards market segmentation where economic flows seem to run in separate, compartmentalised channels and networks... The bazaar, to conclude, is the model of agrarian markets we have been looking for.” (84). It is this last component on which I focus. ‘Networks’ as both a metaphor and a statistical, measurable feature of ancient society have recently begun to invade the literature. Brughmans 2012 gives an overview of the historiography of network approaches to archaeology. He draws attention to the work of Wasserman and Faust (1994: 4) that illustrates the social assumptions of network analysis: -Actors and their actions are viewed as interdependent rather than independent, autonomous units. \- Relational ties (linkages) between actors are channels for transfer or “flow” of resources (either material or nonmaterial). \- Network models focusing on individuals view the network structural environment as providing opportunities for or constraints on individual action. \- Network models conceptualize structure (social, economic, political, and so forth) as lasting patterns of relations among actors.  (Brughamns 2012: An Introduction to SNA). In a recent application of network theory to the problems of Greek colonization, Malkin (2011: 18-19) argues that since we can never know the exact, perfect ‘wiring’ of any ancient network, it is better to use ‘network analysis’ and its concepts metaphorically. This would miss an opportunity. A network approach should properly not stop at ‘network’ as metaphor. It should outline as fully as possible the connections relevant to the question we are asking, to understand the implications of the topology (pattern of connections) for what they might mean for history. A small-world, in network terms, is one where most connections are local and short, while a handful of individuals have connections that connect otherwise disparate parts of the network. This allows whatever flows through the network to reach all its parts quite quickly (Buchanan 2002; Milgram 1967; Watts and Strogatz 1998; Watts 1999). Consequently, as Brughmans points out, a social network with this pattern of connections would have implications for our understanding of the processes underlying its formation, such as the spread of religious ideas or the establishment of social norms or political power (2010). Bang’s model of the bazaar (2008; 2006), and the role of social networks within that model, can be simulated computationally. What follows is a speculative attempt to do so, and should be couched in all appropriate caveats and warnings. Networks can be discerned and drawn out from archaeology, prosopography, and historical sources (e.g., Brughmans 2010; Manning 2010; Ruffini 2008; Graham and Ruffini 2007; Graham 2006a). If the networks we see in the ancient evidence correspond to networks generated from the computational simulation of our models for the ancient economy, we have a powerful tool for exploring antiquity, for playing with different ideas about how the ancient world worked (cf. Dibble 2006). Computation might be able to bridge our models and our evidence. In this paper, I develop a simple simulation that represents a _starting_ point for bringing this agenda about, and explore some of its consequences. **The Bazaar and the New Institutional Economics**
