# Netlogo and GIS - Backspaces.net

If you're at all interested in the intersection between GIS and Agent Modelling, you need to be following[ Andrew Crooks' GIS Agents blog](http://gisagents.blogspot.com/). I haven't been there in a while, but this morning discovered courtesy of Andrew the '[Netlogo Bag of Tricks](http://backspaces.net/wiki/NetLogo_Bag_of_Tricks)' from [Backspaces.net](http://backspaces.net). My Antonine Itineraries model was built on the back of one of the Backspace models a number of years ago. In the 'Bag of Tricks', they show how to have the agents move on the pattern of a network architecture, rather than by following the patches themselves. This is a far more elegant solution! Their example model simulates the movement of water-borne traffic in Venice. It would be interesting to reimplement my Antonine Itineraries models according to this method (rather than the raster patch), and see if I end up with similar results.
