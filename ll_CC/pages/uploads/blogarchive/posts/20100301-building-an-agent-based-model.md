# Building an Agent Based Model

A number of years ago, I had the pleasure of participating in a workshop led by [Mike Gizzi](http://www.professorgizzi.org/) and [James Steiner](http://turtlezero.com/index.php); at that time, Mike had some excellent handouts and notes about the process of model building. Mike's since moved on to other things, but via James' site, I came across those notes - well worth considering if you are about to embark on the possibilities of agent modeling in your own research! ![](http://www.professorgizzi.org/modelingcomplexity/netlogo/overview-large.png) (click on the image for the tutorial).
