# box, Slideshare, and Angel

At a number of places I teach, we use ANGEL as our LMS.Â  One can of course upload content into Angel, and have students look at it - powerpoints, recordings, images, whatever. So far, so ho-hum. One thing that I am concerned about though is ownership of any materials that I have created that I upload into Angel. Depending on where you work, this could get dicey. So I've recently starting using '[box](http://www.box.net)' to upload and host my audio lectures, and deliver them to the students in Angel. I could of course just upload into my space here on wordpress, or onto any number of servers I have access to. But that's fiddly - and box is free. No messing with ftp. AND, the link to the files is a secure one, so I don't have to worry that somebody will stumble across my lecture via Google. Similarly, [slideshare ](http://www.slideshare.net)does a great job of delivering slides (and it will sync audio to them). When I first started playing with slideshare, anything you put on there was public, but I see now that I can control the privacy to a degree. After you upload your slides, you can set a contact list of people who are allowed to see them. This is a bit more fiddly than box, but if you've got the course roster handy, maybe not so much of a problem. And of course you can embed the slides a la youtube, so integration into Angel should be straight forward. Of course, I haven't tried _that_ yet; there's usually some kind of kink needing straightening.
