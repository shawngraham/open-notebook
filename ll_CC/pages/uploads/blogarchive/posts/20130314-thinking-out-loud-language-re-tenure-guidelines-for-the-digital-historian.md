# Thinking out loud: language re tenure guidelines for the Digital Historian

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="151"]![](http://www.viewclips.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Tenure-2009.jpg) I've not actually seen this.[/caption] At my university, we've been asked to consider discipline-specific language for new tenure & promotion guidelines. I've been writing a response to our chair, and I thought, in keeping with how I regard this problem, it would be a good idea to share these thoughts. Onwards. The 1.4 edition of the Journal of Digital Humanities wrestles with the problem of evaluating digital scholarship for tenure http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/volumes/  (or download as pdf: http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/files/jdh_1_4.pdf ) **Moving Goalposts**** & Scholarship as Processes** As far as discipline specific guidelines are concerned, from my perspective, is the problem that the goalposts are always going to be shifting. What was fairly technically demanding becomes easier with time, and so the focus shifts from 'can we do x' to 'what are the implications of x for y', or as Bethany Nowviskie put it, a shift from 18th century '[Lunaticks](http://nowviskie.org/2012/lunaticks/)' who lay the groundwork for 19th century science and industrialization. Another problem is that in digital work, the lone scholar is very much the outlier. To achieve anything worthwhile takes a team - and who gets to be first author does not necessarily reflect the way the work was divied up or undertaken.  We should resist trying to shoehorn digital work into boxes meant for a different medium. Nowiskie writes, "The danger here ... is that T&P committees faced with the work of a digital humanities scholar will instigate a search for print equivalencies — aiming to map every project that is presented to them, to some other completed, unary and generally privately-created object (like an article, an edition, or a monograph). That mapping would be hard enough in cases where it is actually appropriate " She goes on to say, "...t_he new responsibility_ of tenure and promotion committees [is] to assess quality in digital humanities work — _not_ in terms of product or output — but as embodied in an evolving and continuous series of transformative _processes_." [(http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-collaborative-digital-scholarship-by-bethany-nowviskie/](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-collaborative-digital-scholarship-by-bethany-nowviskie/)) This was the gist of Bill Turkel's address to the[ Underhill Graduate Students Colloquium](http://www3.carleton.ca/underhill/) on 'doing history in real time' - that the unique value, in an increasingly digital world, of formal academic knowledge is not about _things_ per se, but rather about _method_. You can look up any fact in the world in seconds. But learning how to think, how to query, how to judge between competing stories - that's what we bring.  That then is the problem for assessing digital work as part of tenure and promotion: how does this work change the process? That suggests a hierarchy too, of importance. Merely putting things online, while important, is not necessarily transformative _unless that kind of material has never been digitized before_. Then the conversation also becomes about how that work was done, the decisions made, the relationship between the digital object and the physical one. I have a s[tudent working on a project,](http://myforeignland.wordpress.com) for instance, to put together an online exhibition related to Black History in Canada. This is important, but the exhibition itself is not transformative. The real scholarship, the real transformation, happens when she starts exploring those materials through text analysis, putting a macroscopic lens on the whole corpus of materials that she has collected. **Digital Work is Public Work** The other important point about process is that digital work always (99.9 times out of 100; my early agent modeling work had no internet presence, for instance) has a public, outward looking face. Platforms like blogs allow for public engagement with our work - so digital work is a kind of public humanities. The structure of the internet, of how its algorithmns find and construct knowledge and serve that up to us via Google, is such that work that is valuable and of interest creates a bigger noise in a positive feedback loop. The best digital work is done in public. 'Public' should not be a dirty word along the lines of 'popular'. The internet looks different to each person who goes online (and our algorithmns make sure that each person sees a personalized internet, because that's how one makes money online), so hits on a blog post are not random meaningless clicks but rather an engagement with a broader community. As far as academic blogging goes, that broader community is other academics and students. Print journals & peer reviewed articles are just one way of engaging with our chosen communities. With post-publication models of peer review like [Digital Humanities Now ](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/)and the [Journal of Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/) (models that are making inroads in other disciplines), we should treat these on an equal footing with the more familiar models. I'd argue that post-publication peer review is a greater indicator of significance and value that a regular, two blind reviewers into print model. I'd like to see language then that regarded digital work, or work in media other than print, on an equal footing with the more familiar forms. That is, as things that do not have equivalencies to what we traditionally expect and thus must be taken on their own terms.  I appreciate that I'm pretty much the only person in this department that any of this might apply to, _for the time being_. I would hate to see my work on topic modeling though get considered as 'service'. Figuring out how to apply natural language processing to vast corpi of historical materials, figuring out the ways the code force particular worldviews, hide others, and writing all of this up as a 'how-to' guide is indeed research. It's akin to figuring out how gene-sequencing works, its limitations, etc, which needs to be well understood before a biologist can use it to link modern humans to Neanderthals. We understand both of those activities as research, in biology, but we'd only understand the second as research if the example was the limits, potentials of topic modeling / discourses in the political thought of the 18th century. I bring this up, because of Sean Takats experience at George Mason: [ http://quintessenceofham.org/2013/02/07/a-digital-humanities-tenure-case-part-2-letters-and-committees/](http://quintessenceofham.org/2013/02/07/a-digital-humanities-tenure-case-part-2-letters-and-committees/) **Project Management**** & Project Outputs** In that particular case, Takats was also managing major development projects to develop various tools and approaches. He writes, " I want to focus on the committee’s disregard for project management, because it’s here I think that we find evidence of a much broader communication breakdown between DH and just-H, despite [the best efforts to develop reasonable standards for evaluating digital scholarship](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/). Although the committee’s letter effectively excludes “project management” from consideration as research, I would argue that it’s actually the cornerstone of all successful research. It’s project management that transforms a dissertation prospectus into a thesis, and it’s certainly project management that shepherds a monograph from proposal to published book. Fellow humanists, I have some news for you: you’re all project managers, even if you only direct a staff of one."
