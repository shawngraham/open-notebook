# The London Charter

Speaking of archaeological VR, [the London Charter](http://www.londoncharter.org/index.html) is worth consideration. Its objectives are below (I think the last one on the list is especially important), but there's a lot of material to mull over... 

> Objectives
> 
> The London Charter seeks to establish principles for the use of 3d visualisation methods and outcomes in the research and communication of cultural heritage in order to: **Provide a benchmark ** having widespread recognition among stakeholders.  **Promote intellectual and technical rigour ** in such uses.  **Enable appropriate evaluative criteria and methods **to be determined and applied. **Stimulate debate **on methodological issues. **Offer a robust foundation ** upon which specialist subject communities can build detailed standards and guides.  **Ensure appropriate access and sustainability strategies **to be determined and applied.  **Enable 3d visualisation authoritatively to contribute **to the study, interpretation and management of cultural heritage assets.
