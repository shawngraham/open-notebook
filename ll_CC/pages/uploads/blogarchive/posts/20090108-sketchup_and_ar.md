# Sketchup + Augmented Reality

This is AWESOME: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsQ-YGgVUT0] [Digital Urban posted that video](http://digitalurban.blogspot.com/2008/12/augmented-reality-and-google-sketchup.html) just the other day, and as they say, the potential is fantastic. More from them: 

> All you need to make ARplug-in [for sketchup] work is a personal computer, a webcam and a printed code attached to the software. For optimal functionality, a Dual-core PC with a standard graphic card for 3D videogames are recommended, see [AR-media for full details](http://www.inglobetechnologies.com/en/products/arplugin_su/info.php) and download. A free demo version is available with the full version coming in at 99 euros.
