# Archaeology Island in Second Life

Scott Moore is detailing his archaeological projects in Second Life over on his [blog](http://ancienthistory.typepad.com/ancient_history_ramblings/). Yesterday, he and his colleagues [made a presentation](http://ancienthistory.typepad.com/ancient_history_ramblings/2007/12/sl-demo.html) to his university trustees about what they are doing, which include a virtual Parthenon, Mayan temple, and a shipwreck. Sounds fantastic, and I can't wait to come visit! [Robert Welch University](http://www.robertwelchuniversity.org) is also planning a small presence in Second Life, which will be more to bring our distance students together than to do any large-scale simulation, although I'm planning a tetris-style immersive game to help with the Latin teaching. ![Scott's Parthenon](http://ancienthistory.typepad.com/ancient_history_ramblings/images/2007/12/11/athena_parthenos_001.jpg) [Scott's Parthenon](http://ancienthistory.typepad.com/ancient_history_ramblings/2007/12/back-to-sl.html)
