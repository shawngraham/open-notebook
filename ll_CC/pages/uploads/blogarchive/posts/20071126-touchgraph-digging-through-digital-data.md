# Touchgraph: digging through digital data

When I was untangling the [social networks in Roman stamped brick](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEx-Figlinis-Dynamics-Hinterland-International%2Fdp%2F184171738X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1196108999%26sr%3D8-1&tag=electarchadig-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=electarchadig-20&l=ur2&o=1), I used the [UCINET and Keyplayer](http://www.analytictech.com/) programs almost exclusively. These are still probably the best tools out there for doing high-end social networks analyses on large volumes of data. But what about digital data? Sometimes, it is useful to know how websites tie together, who is linking to whom, other similar sites (based on linkages) and so on. For that, you might want to use [Touchgraph](http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html). In its early days, it had a handy tool for seeing who linked to a particular site; in the current version, it seems to only have one way out links. Still, it might be handy for someone... ![touchgraph.jpg](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/touchgraph.jpg) (Touchgraph of Electric Archaeology)
