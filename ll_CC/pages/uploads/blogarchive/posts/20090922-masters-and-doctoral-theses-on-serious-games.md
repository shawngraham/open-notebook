# Masters and Doctoral Theses on Serious Games

A list maintained by Katrin Becker at SFU, '[Serious Games Pathfinder](http://www.minkhollow.ca/becker/doku.php?id=pf:theses)': 

> The following is a list of Master's and Doctoral theses that have been completed that have to do with serious games (and in some cases more broadly with digital games). Doctoral Theses are marked in **bold**. You can get more info on each thesis by clicking on the associated 'details' link. Note: I am just starting to develop this list. So far, almost all the theses are Canadian ones. If anyone has a thesis they would like me to add, please let me know the following: Name, Title, Year, Degree, Country, Institution, Department, Abstract, URL to the thesis (If you are willing, I'd like your nationality too).

> **Please send info on theses that are about _DIGITAL GAMES_ ONLY** (I am not interested in theses about Game Theory (i.e. math), ELearning, Virtual Spaces, Social Websites, Blogging, Graphics, AI, … UNLESS they specifically focus on applications to or for digital games)

I reproduce below the listing she has for 2008:
