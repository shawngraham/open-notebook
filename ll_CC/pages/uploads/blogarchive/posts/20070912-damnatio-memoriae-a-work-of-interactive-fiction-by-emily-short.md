# Damnatio Memoriae, a work of Interactive Fiction by Emily Short

I am, amongst other things, interested in interactive fiction for teaching, learning, and research. And of course I'm not a dried-up old prune: I like these things to be fun too! [Emily Short](http://emshort.wordpress.com/) is currently one of the best writers of interactive fiction - here's a piece by her with a Roman flavour, ['Damnatio Memoriae'](http://inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/dm/)

> "14 AD. Agrippa Postumus, grandson of the recently-deceased Augustus, tries to avoid death at the hands of the next emperor, Tiberius. At his disposal: a couple of old manuscripts, a lamp, and a recalcitrant slave. And a powerful knowledge of the Art of Venus Genetrix, of course -- the magic eventually known as the Lavori d'Aracne. Damnatio Memoriae belongs to a series with the author's previous game Savoir-Faire; though it can stand alone, the game's mechanics will make most sense to players already familiar with that work. It is a fast, timed game, taking only a few minutes to play once, but probably requiring multiple attempts to bring to a satisfactory conclusion."
