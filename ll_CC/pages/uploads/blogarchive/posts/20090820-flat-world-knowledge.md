# Flat World Knowledge

Text book prices getting you down? Tired of copy-and-pasting, photocopying and printing the relevant bits from textbooks for your class? You might want to take a look at [Flat World Knowledge](http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/) Apparently, this company - Flat World - Â produces digital-rights-free textbooks, which can then be used however a person wishes . If you view them in a browser, no cost; download the pdf, $20; ask for a bound version, $60. This has enormous potential to shake things up, I would think! I wonder what they've got in their catalogue. Their tagline is, 'Remixable textbooks by expert authors, free online and affordable off'. Their books are peer-reviewed. Seems they do audio and pda versions, too.
