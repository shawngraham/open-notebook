# Let's write a textbook

I've been talking with the folks at [Flatworld Knowledge](http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/) about the kinds of textbooks they're looking for, and it was suggested that a world history textbook might be just the ticket. These things are typically in two volumes - before and after 1500. Who wants to write a textbook? To my mind, writing another textbook that does the usual roundup of periods/cultures is not perhaps useful. As the [Barenaked Ladies](http://barenakedladies.com/) are wont to say, '[It's all been done before!](http://barenakedladies.com/node/1244) ' A new medium of producing, distributing a textbook - a medium that allows for the content to be remixed by instructors at the coal-face, to suit their needs (read Flatworld's material for more on that) it seems to me, needs a new approach. The folks at Grand Text Auto did a[ blog-based peer review](http://grandtextauto.org/2009/05/12/blog-based-peer-review-four-surprises/) for [this book](http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu/2009/08/expressive-processing-arrives/); perhaps a new world history textbook could be written via blog-based posts & peer review? Also, could it be written in such a way as to foreground networks & connections between times, places, and peoples: a 21st century textbook?[ Horden and Purcell's](http://books.google.com/books?id=R8GhRYNrkzYC&dq=horden+purcell+sea&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=ZX0YuFNljN&sig=y8-mSs_ab2FAUfJlhmOxOSALDls&hl=en&ei=JXfDSsG6N5DqsQOIkbzNAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ) volume from a few years back is apposite here; also is [Urry's Sociology beyond Societies](http://books.google.com/books?id=ogyDBobOHVEC&dq=urry+sociology+beyond+societies&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=8SPEdyw61o&sig=4qsMCHzeCpHTrssHEoXNw2Jo8OY&hl=en&ei=R3fDStntJIv8sQO4wtHJAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAg)... ...I'm just thinking out loud. Your thoughts?
