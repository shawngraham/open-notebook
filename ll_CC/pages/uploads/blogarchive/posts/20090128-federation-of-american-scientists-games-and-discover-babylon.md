# Federation of American Scientists, Games, and Discover Babylon

Fascinating report from the Federation of American Scientists: they support the use of commerical off the shelf games for science education! C'mon archaeologists... Report [here;](http://www.fas.org/gamesummit/) and a game called '[Discover Babylon'](http://fas.org/babylon/) :![](http://www.fas.org/gamesummit/pics/uruk_render_05.jpg)

> The game is divided into three periods of Mesopotamian history: The Uruk Period (3300-3000 BC) when writing was first developing; the Ur III period (2100-2000 BC), a time of great cities and central organization; and the Neo-Assyrian period (1000-600 BC), a time of empires. [...] The game opens with a cataclysmic event—an earthquake in Baltimore. The player quickly learns that this event is caused by an ingenious archaeologist named Dexter who has figured out how to travel back in time, accidentally and unknowingly wreaking havoc with the fabric of time. The storyline then unfolds, compelling the player to go on a series of missionsto ancient Iraq to find Dex and restore the fabric of time The player travels back in time, ‘leaping’ into the body of several historically attested characters. In the first level, the player assumes the character of Taribi, a 12 year old boy studying to be a scribe. Living a day in Taribi’s life, the player is challenged to learn what he would have learned in school. Players are encouraged to learn by discovery and to experience one of the earliest cities, Uruk ca. 3100 BC.

Looks like I'll be busy for a while...   hmm. nothing on the site seems to be more recent than 2006, and the images do not load... has the game died?
