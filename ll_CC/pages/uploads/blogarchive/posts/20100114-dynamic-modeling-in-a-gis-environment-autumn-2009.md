# Dynamic Modeling in a GIS Environment Autumn 2009

Courtesy of Andrew Crooks [GIS and Agent Modelling blog](http://www.gisagents.blogspot.com/) , I learn today of a [series of seminars exploring the latest in GIS & dynamic modelling, at the Global GIS Academy](http://www.wun.ac.uk/ggisa/seminars/archive/autumn09_programme/index.html) Of particular interest (to me, at any rate) are the following: 

> October 28th **Ling Bian** (Buffalo) A dynamic social network model for disease transmission The work in this presentation was sponsored by a health care agency and some of the results reported remain confidential until we have permission from that agency to make the presentation available.
