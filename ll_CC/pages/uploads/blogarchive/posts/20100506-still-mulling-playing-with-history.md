# Still Mulling Playing with History

I was at the [Playing with History](http://www.playingwithhistory.com/) unconference last week - my first unconference. Twitter'd comments findable at [#pastplay](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23pastplay) What a neat way to spend a couple of days! I'm still mulling it over, my fever'd brain brimming with possibilities, avenues to explore...  For excellent summaries of what went on, see [Rob MacDougall](http://www.robmacdougall.org/index.php/2010/05/pastplay/) and [Geoffrey Rockwell](http://www.philosophi.ca/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithHistory)'s separate evaluations of the day. My discussion pieces on The [NetherNe](http://thenethernet.com)t and '[Rolling your own](http://www.playingwithhistory.com/abstracts/)' went over well (though I could've made things a whole lot clearer with the latter by reminding everyone that my experience there - my glorious failure, I calls it - was in terms of an online class; no matter!) Rob finishes his summary with, 

> I have some qualms about the “digital humanities” label, currently having its Elvis moment. (Not the label, I guess, just the way it’s exploded in the last year or so. The inevitable anti-DH backlash is currently scheduled for Spring 2011; [watch this space](https://twitter.com/).) But I have nothing but love for the people who do this kind of work. Historians powered up with coding chops and tech fu; geeks leavened with humanist soul. What could be better?

This reminded me of this week's[ Escapist, where Jason Della Roca](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_252/7504-Playing-For-Our-Future) writes, 

> There will come a day in the near future when there will be no more gamers. Not because they'll have killed each other in some _Grand Theft Auto_-induced mass rampage, but rather because the term "gamer" will be irrelevant. Much like how we do not call people who view TV shows "watchers," or those that enjoy music as "listeners," playing games will become similarly as pervasive and commonplace as to render the "gamer" distinction archaic.

Some day, in the same way, maybe we'll all be digital humanists...
