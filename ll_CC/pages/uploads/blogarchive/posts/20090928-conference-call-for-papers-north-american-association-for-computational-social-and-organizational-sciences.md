# Conference Call for Papers: NORTH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL SCIENCES

NAACSOS - NORTH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL SCIENCES 2009 NAACSOS Annual Conference October 23-24, 2009 <http://www.asu.edu/clas/csdc/events/naacsos.html> <http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/naacsos/> CALL FOR PAPERS This year our NAACSOS Annual Conference will he held on 23-24 October in Tempe, Arizona. It will be hosted by The Center of Social Dynamics and Complexity at Arizona State University. Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity Tempe, AZ 85287-4804 <http://www.asu.edu/clas/csdc/> Over the past decade simulating social processes has achieved some level of credibility -- and yet progress in this area is stifled because of the lack of agreement on several critical core features. The objective of the 2009 conference is to allow scientists the opportunity to present work in this area that extends and solidifies the legitimacy of this methodology. Specifically, the conference organizers are asking that presenters use their models to address some of the following: · Platform selection · Validation – using theoretical constructs or extant data · Agent construction · Designing social simulations experiments · Integrating humans into simulations · Integrating GIS and time into models · Data reduction and analysis of simulation outcomes · Integrating social network methods into simulation models · Integrating feedback into agent behavior · Agent and system evolution using agent cooperation and competition · Integrating Individual based models from biology and ecology with agent based models · Interfacing social simulation and social science theory construction All fields of social and organizational inquiry are encouraged, including disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary work. Integrative research in computational social and organizational sciences is particularly encouraged. Submission of Abstracts Electronic submissions of abstracts (300 words maximum) will be through EasyChair (<http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=2009naacsos>). The abstract should articulate the objectives of the presenter, a brief but thorough description of the research, and the expected gain by those attending the talk. Specific details about submission will posted on the conference website: <http://www.asu.edu/clas/csdc/events/naacsos.html> . Important Dates July 15, 2009: Deadline for submission of abstracts or proposed posters. August 15, 2009: Acceptance/Rejection notification. October 15, 2009: Final camera-ready abstracts due in electronic form. Accepted abstracts will be distributed to the conference participants. Review process All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least two reviewers. We will be accepting only those abstracts that indicate high quality research and are consistent with the objectives of the conference. Conference Chair William A.
