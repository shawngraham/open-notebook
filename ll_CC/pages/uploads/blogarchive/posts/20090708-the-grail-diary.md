# The Grail Diary

...can be downloaded [here](http://www.replacementdocs.com/request.php?569). Every archaeologist should have one of these! This is from back in the day when game makers included all sorts of extra goodies and trinkets to enhance the immersion in their games. I miss those days. Now, I have to buy the tennis rackets, or the steering wheel, for only $$ extra. The game in question was the tie in for the movie: Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade - The Graphic Adventure.Â  In a way, I see a connection between those days and the current DIY approach to solving ARGs... just a thought for later.

When I bought my copy of Riven it came with a an ornate blank journal that was for you to use to make notes in as you played the game. You would not make it far without taking your own notes and so this journal became a 'real world' of the game that would develop of grow as you played through the game. Those were great thinking games and the journal connection to the 'real world' was engaging and added satisfaction to the experience. I've not enjoyed a game as much since then.

**[Stu Eve](#2157 "2009-07-08 08:32:40"):** Wow this is great! Well-written as well! I particularly like the telegram from the archaeologist in Rome, who is bringing an important piece of Grail History to the States on the new British Liner Titanic! I totally agree with your mourning of the lack of extras shipped with games now-a-days. I blame the DVD jewel case, barely enough room in there for an instruction manual! It does raise issues of the modern immersive worlds being entirely within the computer (i.e. world of warcraft), where all the material culture is basically stored within the WoW servers, rather than leaking out into the 'real world'. Although, looking at the new Augmented Reality stuff coming out and as you say the ARG culture, this may be changing quite soon. I think we are probably still quite a way off from creating a virtual world more convincing than the real world - so this move back toward real story-telling within 'World1.0' is very welcome! Thanks for the great blog. Stu PS. Back to the Grail Diary, rather than just putting the link on your blog, "You should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers".
