# Visualisation in Archaeology

An interesting project hosted by Southampton in the UK and English Heritage - see the [full website here](http://www.viarch.org.uk/). They're hosting what looks to be a fascinating wee conference in October: Visualisation In Context: An Interplay of Practice and Theory 22 - 23 October 2009 Hosted by the University of Southampton The [2009 VIA Workshop](http://www.viarch.org.uk/content/research-workshop-2009.asp) is designed to probe the intersections between theory (which might traditionally be represented in terms of critique - linear and written) and practice (which might increasingly be expressed in terms of production - non-linear and visual) within the field of archaeology as well as other disciplines from the humanities and the sciences. Check out the VIA  showcase:

Centred on the visualisation of data in both archaeology and the wider fields of the social sciences, arts, and science and technology studies. Like the bibliography, these summaries aim to link practitioners across disciplines, highlight innovative visual projects, and offer a platform for future planning and discussion of best practices around archaeological visual method and theory.
