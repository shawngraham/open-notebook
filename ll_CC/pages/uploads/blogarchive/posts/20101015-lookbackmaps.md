# LookBackMaps

An[ article in the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/a-new-wrinkle-in-time/8249) bemoans the passing of the wristwatch. But as it does so, it mentions a rather interesting iPhone app: 

> [...] LookBackMaps, a San Francisco Web development company, has created an iPhone mapping app that lets the user overlay historical photographs of places onto the iPhone’s camera view, combining past and present in a single picture—crowding wagons and horses, cobblestones and ghostly pedestrians into modern cityscapes. [...]

Here's a video of the iphone app in action: http://vimeo.com/7765446 [LookBackMaps can be found here.](http://lookbackmaps.net/index.php) I've got some of my digital history students very interested in ideas surrounding location-based computing, and the melding of the interweb with physcial geography. My list of tools for them to explore grows every day! I had shown them what the Museum of London was up to with their [StreetMuseum app](http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/MuseumOfLondon/Resources/app/you-are-here-app/index.html); the LookBackMaps tool would seem to permit that same kind of functionality.   ![](http://assets.theatlantic.com/static/coma/images/issues/201011/wrist-watch-wide.jpg)
