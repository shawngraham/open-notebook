# Review of Malkin, "A Small Greek World: Networks in the Ancient Mediterranean"

> **Irad Malkin** OUP USA 304 pages | 21 illustrations | 235x156mm 978-0-19-973481-8 | Hardback | 24 November 2011 **Price: ****£40.00** <http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199734818.do>

I was excited to obtain this book. Unfortunately, this is a book about social network analysis in antiquity that does not, in point of fact, contain any social network analysis. Rather, Malkin uses concepts drawn from networks and theories of evolving networks as metaphors to reframe centre-periphery arguments about the emergence of the Greek world around the Mediterranean as a 'small world'. There is much that is good with this book, in terms of its description of colonization and the emergence of the Greek world. He offers up a theory of 'backwards-propagation' to explain how the colonies could often be more Greek than Greece. As a Canadian educated in the UK, I know that this is a very real - and timeless- phenomenon; it is indeed a useful concept to bring into the discussion. However, Malkin need never have invoked any network theories in order to use that concept. Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell's _[The Corrupting Sea](http://www.amazon.ca/Corrupting-Sea-Study-Mediterranean-History/dp/0631218904)_ achieved much by focusing on the idea of connectivity of micro-regions without invoking social network analysis; this work is essentially a deeper exploration of that idea. The broad strokes of Greek colonization are well known; there is ample material there for network studies of many different kinds (including work that seeks to generate likely networks, for example as in [Rihll & Wilson 1991](http://www.google.ca/search?rlz=1C1WZPD_enCA400CA400&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=rihll+and+wilson+gravity+settlement+model+greece+1991), [the work of Tim Evans, Ray Rivers, and Carl Knappet](http://utoronto.academia.edu/CarlKnappett/Papers/571174/Network_models_and_archaeological_spaces)t, my own [Travellersim](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/travellersim-growing-settlement-structures-and-territories-with-agent-based-modeling-full-text/)). Malkin lays out the groundwork of the relevant concepts in chapter 1. But on p18 and 19 one reads, 

> Graphic illustrations of wide-ranging Mediterranean networks in the form of connective graphs usually prove to be unhelpful. Two-dimensional representations of connectivity mostly turn out to be messy "spaghetti monsters" with very long verbal explanations that are needed to accompany them... I have opted for the larger canvass of what seems to me highly probable at the risk of not presenting statistics and formulae that I am incapable of offering due to the state of our sources of knowledge"

Malkin takes pains on p16 to distinguish between ordinary (whatever that may mean) 'networks' and the 'networks' of network analysis, as if the two were distinguishable. They are not. The only difference is that in one we are using a metaphor, and in the other, we have taken pains to try to outline as fully as possible the connections relevant to the question we are asking, to understand the implications of the topology (yes, the statistics) for what they might mean for history. To invoke a small-world (a precise concept in network terms) without actually measuring to see if small world conditions are fulfilled does damage to the concept and to the analysis. Elijah Meeks has recently written about[ developing conventions for the representation of network data](https://dhs.stanford.edu/spatial-humanities/comparing-geographic-visualizations-to-network-visualizations/), drawing on the long history of cartographic literacy. As far as Malkin's critique of the _visualization _of networks go, it's well founded: but the visualization has never been the endpoint, the raison d'etre, for the exercise. It's the statistics. If you don't know the shape of the thing, the important nodes (cities, individuals, extra-urban sanctuaries, what have you), how can you claim to be doing any sort of network analysis? Scott Weingart has written about 'halting conditions', about knowing [where to draw the line](http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=12736)when your data are necessarily complex and in practice, infinite: 

> The humanities, well… we’re used to a tradition that involves very deep and particular reading. The tiniest stones of our studied objects do not go unturned. The idea that a first pass, _an incomplete pass_, can lead to anything at all, let alone analysis and release, is almost anathema to the traditional humanistic mindset. Herein lies the problem of humanities big data. We’re trying to measure the length of a coastline by sitting on the beach with a ruler, rather flying over with a helicopter and a camera. And humanists know that, like the sandy coastline shifting with the tides, our data are constantly changing with each new context or interpretation. Cartographers are aware of this problem, too, but they’re still able to make fairly accurate maps.

It is not acceptable for ancient historians to bemoan the incompleteness of our sources - to use that as a crutch for not doing something - and then to go on and write another 224 pages. We've been studying the ancient world for several centuries now. Surely we've got enough material to be able to draw a line, to map something out, yes? Should you buy this book? By all means, yes. Its roundup of the major themes and ideas in network studies in chapter 1 is valuable, and will no doubt be useful for those wishing to do formal network analysis, insofar as it establishes network theory in the broader classicist conversation. I've focused primarily on the first chapter in this review, since much of my teaching and research at the moment explicitly concerns network analysis in antiquity. The materials presented in subsequent chapters (Island Networking and Hellenic Convergence; Sicily and the Greeks; Herakles and Melqart; Networks and Middle Grounds in the Western Mediterranean; Cult and Identity in the Far West) do indeed move the conversation on from stale center-periphery models, and should be lauded. It would perhaps have been better though if it had not been framed in terms of a theoretical/methodological framework that is not, in fact, used. [disclosure: I asked Oxford UP for a review copy when I saw it in the catalogue, in the hopes that I could use it as a text in an upcoming course on digital antiquity. I do not think I will be doing so, given my issues indicated here.]

**[weheartit.com](#11662 "2013-12-15 19:13:31"):** May HGH Supplements Boost Slim Body-mass HGH, human growth hormone could be the hormone in the human body in charge oof increasing lean body mass together with maintaining its integrity and health. The medical title for this hormone is somatotropin. Lots of people appear to misread the type oof HGH inside the human anbatomy and do not grasp exactly what this hormone does. Human growth hormone is capable of stimulating the growth of lean muscle mass, repairs to destroyed cells, and substitute of dead ones. As time goes by we obviously commence to make less of it over a daily basis. In the age of thirty the average output amount of somatotropin within the human anatomy will waver betwween four hundred and five hundred micrograms. Thhat is centered on activity-level and in some instances gender. That generation can diminish to approximately half that quantity at agge forty. However, from thhe moment this individual reaches era ninety they'll create around twenty-five micrograms on the average. Which means the average person can generate twenty times less HGH about the average at age eighty as they can at age twenty. Supplements for HGH aren't actually presenting your body more human growth hormone. These products supply essential amino acids that the anterior pituitary gland uses to generate HGH. This does not suggvest they are hoaxes or nugatory. They are doing work, and work nicely for the purpose of aiding inside the increase of lean body-mass. muscle msss gainer supplements (weheartit.com) Nonetheless, it ought to be noted that there iss a peculiar thought that applying HGH supplements will turn an average individual right into a super-human muscle-building machine. Thiis is not true. A superb, stable, HGH supplement works well for many people and be virtually useless for others. You'll find two major components that determine how well an effective complement will continue to work for you. These aspects are era and task. http://capetown.backpage.com/CreativeServices/big-mugo-penis-enlargement-cream-3-days-guarantee-beauty-ultimate-4all-johannesburg-pretoria/2534249 An eighty year old male or female that works out each day will find that a superb supplement will aid them out to an unbelievable, almost staggeringly powerful, amount. A twenty-year old male or female that sits around consuming potato chips and playing video gaming all time can seldom discover any transform at all. In every honesty a twenty-year old power lifter will not be likely note that much difference either. The truth within this issue is that HGH supplements can help increase lean body-mass but only in individuals that need the boost. A young highly-active individual previously produces the maximum amount of HGH the human body can use naturally anyway. The remainder is squandered. For these individuals they would be better supported by way of a simple multivitamin. To drive the body to construct considerably larger amounts of lean muscle mass using HGH at a newer age will demand the utilization of injections. It is a normally illegal strategy without medical reasons.

If you still want more information, you can also search the Internet for other sources. Using this feature you can also fix the vignette problems and chromatic aberrations in your picture easily.

Select the Paint - Brush Tool, select the soft round or "fuzzy" brush shape at the top and set the size to fit whatever area you are working on. GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is one of the most popular alternatives to Photoshop, as it has many of the same tools and features of Photoshop while also allowing you to add more tools through the use of plugins.
