# Open source virtual world: Croquet

I'm sure I've mentioned this one before, but if not, check out [this post here](http://saulnier.typepad.com/learning_technology/2008/01/immersive-educa.html) to understand a bit more of what's going on on the technological front concerning immersive worlds for learning... and why Croquet might be a better place to spend our time: 

> "The Croquet Constortium is "an open source metaverse software foundation" which has developed [Croquet](http://www.opencroquet.org/), a development environment/architecture for creating virtual worlds. The presentation was given by two of the founding architects of the platform: Julian Lombardi, Duke University's assistant vice president of Academic Services and Technology Support ([Julian's blog](http://jlombardi.blogspot.com/)), and Mark McCahill, also at Duke (and creator of the [Gopher protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol)). Their point was that the Internet was designed as a client-server model back when computing power and bandwidth were scarce, so authoritative servers were needed to provide clients with the necessary state.  But that model is no longer valid -- 30 users can stress a game server using that antiquated architectural model.  And so to build new virtual environments using that schema is thus fundamentally flawed.  Their Croquet platform is peer-to-peer based, so the _users_ retain the current state of the virtual worlds, and new users logging on get the latest version of the world from the closest node on the network.  The architecture stresses the replication of computing rather than of data -- it is a coordination protocol."
