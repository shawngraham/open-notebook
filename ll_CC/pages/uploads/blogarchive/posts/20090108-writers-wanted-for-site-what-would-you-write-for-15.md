# Writers wanted for site - what would you write for $15?

Seeing as how I'm ever short on cash, I thought for a moment the following might buy me some groceries. Question arises - what's the going rate for 'professional' blogging? What kind of quality does $15 buy you? Anyway, if the site gets off the ground, it could well prove interesting, informative, and high quality. Good luck!
