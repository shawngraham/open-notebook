# PMOG is now the Nethernet

Pm0g - the passive multiplayer online game - has gone in for some rebranding, calling itself 'T[he Nethernet'](http://thenethernet.com). I rather like the term, 'nethernet', as it implies a game played in some sort of metaspace outside (above/below/beside) the regular ol' internet. However, in the transition, Nethernet has lost some of the old steampunk aesthetic and charm that Pmog had - whereas before there were scrolls popping up inside your browser, and neo-victorian characters assaulting/assisting you, now there is the same-old same-old web2.0-ish vibe. No doubt the game runs better and is more secure this way, but I rather liked the old charm. For old time's sake, here are my missions made back in the Pmog 0.4 era (and rejigged to run under the new regime):

"How in the world can I find sources on the motivations of ancient Olympic athletes?? Maybe if you told me what to read, then I could answer the question." read the email. The prof looked away from his computer, groaning inwardly. And no doubt, just parrot back to me a webpage, he thought. Why do students expect to be spoon-fed everything? "Follow me. First, let us search 'ancient olympics' properly. Where would you go first, O student at the University of Manitoba with its excellent library resources?'

New long range telescopes have identified a distant, inhabitable planet. There appears to have once been intelligent life...

Between 1867 and 1868, a tiny community at the north end of Salt Spring Island, populated by about 25 families, was the scene of three brutal and seemingly unconnected murders. But were they really unconnected? All of the victims were members of the island's Black community and all of the murders were blamed on Aboriginal people. Two of the murders were officially unsolved. In the case of William Robinson, an all-White jury found an Aboriginal man, Tshuanahusset, guilty of killing the Black settler and sentenced him to death. Was Tshuanahusset guilty? Why was he convicted? If Tshuanahusset did not kill William Robinson, who did? (Great Canadian Mysteries, by John Lutz and Ruth Sandwell)
