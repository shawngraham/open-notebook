# P2PU - the social wrapper on open courseware

Seen today: [P2PU - 'Peer to Peer University](http://p2pu.org/)' on[ Social Media in Learning](http://janeknight.typepad.com/socialmedia/2009/12/p2pu-peer-2-peer-university.html)

> The Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is an online community of open study groups for short university-level courses. Think of it as online book clubs for open educational resources. The P2PU helps you navigate the wealth of open education materials that are out there, creates small groups of motivated learners, and supports the design and facilitation of courses. Students and tutors get recognition for their work, and we are building pathways to formal credit as well.

It's an interesting concept; coming on the heels of what I was thinking about yesterday ([economics of online learning](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/online-education-and-the-economics-of-the-web/)), it'll be interesting to see [what happens next:](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/19510)

> The pilot phase of [P2PU](http://p2pu.org/) (Peer 2 Peer University) ended in October, after having run for six weeks with seven courses and approximately 90 participants. Last month, the pilot phase volunteers, including the course organizers, met in person for the first time at the first ever [P2PU Workshop](http://p2pu.org/Workshop) in Berlin. The goal of the workshop was to integrate pilot phase experiences into a working plan for the future of P2PU. Judging from the [outcomes](http://p2pu.org/Workshop), the workshop achieved its goal. Check out CC Learn’s video download of the workshop at [Blip.tv](http://blip.tv/file/2943928/), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/7982923), or [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toiZvrxqiY).
