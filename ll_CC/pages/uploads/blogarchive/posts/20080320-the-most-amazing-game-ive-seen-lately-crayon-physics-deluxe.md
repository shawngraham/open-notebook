# The most amazing game I've seen lately: Crayon Physics Deluxe

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsTqspnvAaI&eurl=http://www.slate.com/id/2186848] From [Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2186848): "Crayon Physics Deluxe lets you draw objects on the screen by clicking and dragging your mouse, or by drawing with the stylus of a tablet PC, as in this video. The objects you scrawl become part of the game world. The goal is to create objects that propel a crudely drawn ball toward a crudely drawn star. There is no single correct way to scoot that ball around; the fun is in exploring the options. Within seconds of hitting start, you're furiously scribbling blocks and ramps and wedges and seesaws, whatever it takes to reach the goal. Some players may get sidetracked creating hilariously inefficient Rube Goldberg devices. Others will forget the objectives altogether and just draw. (If you want to try it yourself, you can download a simpler demo version of the game _[here](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/crayon)_.) " The prototype of this game was built in under a week. The maker of this game, Petri Purho, is a 24 year old student. The man has talent! Also, as an archaeologist and educator, I was delighted to read the following: "There are many games based on the exploits of Indiana Jones, but [Purho's version](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/boulder)** **is the only one that tells the story from the boulder's point of view, letting players control the rampaging sphere and smoosh wave after wave of attacking archeologists. Another game, [Grammar Nazi](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/grammar), is a literate twist on shooters like Space Invaders. Players fire upward at swarms of enemies, but the ammo in Purho's version is the letters you type on the keyboard, and the longer the words you spell, the more damage they do. (Tapping out _indie_ has some impact. _Autodidact_ causes a massive explosion.) Purho made it in a single day. " Be the boulder. Oh yeaaah....
