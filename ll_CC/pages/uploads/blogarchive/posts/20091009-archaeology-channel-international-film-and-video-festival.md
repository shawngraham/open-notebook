# Archaeology Channel International Film and Video Festival

In my inbox: *Your time is running out! Only eight days remain* to submit entries for the 2010 edition of *The Archaeology Channel* International Film and Video Festival. This is the only international competition for this genre in the entire Western Hemisphere and a wonderful showcase for your work. Our deadline for receipt of entries is *October 15**, 2009*. TAC Festival 2010 takes place May 18-22, 2010, in the Soreng Theater of the Hult Center for the Performing Arts here in Eugene, Oregon, USA. Attached here is the entry form with our guidelines. Please read the guidelines carefully, as we depend on you for accurate information. Further information is posted at [http://www.archaeol ogychannel. org/content/ TACfestival. shtml.](http://www.archaeologychannel.org/content/TACfestival.shtml.) Have you been procrastinating? *Please* do not wait to send your entries, because a burdensome flood of entries at the last moment will slow down our review and notification process. In previous years, some entries regrettably were rejected because of errors in entry forms or problems with the film review copies. If you allow plenty of time for these problems to be resolved, you can help assure that you will not be excluded from consideration. Also, we encourage you to make plans to attend the Festival to represent your films and also to participate in our Conference on Cultural Heritage Film. For our last Festival, we received 87 entries from 25 countries. We hope to exceed those numbers this year and to attract the worldâ€™s best films in our genre to this competition, but we need your help to accomplish this. With your support and participation, we can continue to grow TAC Festival as a promotional tool for your good work. Please share this announcement with others you know who may have films suitable for entry. Many thanks and best wishes to you all. Richard M.
