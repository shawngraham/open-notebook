# Agent based modelling of the Hispanic Baroque

The [Hispanic Baroque project at UWO ](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/)has quite a complex simulation underway, exploring 

> [...] the origin, evolution, transmission and effectiveness of the baroque patterns of behaviour and representation in the Hispanic world. [...] The objectives of the project are: to describe the most common, resistant baroque patterns in different environments; to establish its relationship with processes of social identity and organization; to analyze the technologies of culture that have made this adaptability of the baroque possible; to determine its effectiveness based on the reappearance in Neo-baroque phenomena of the contemporary world; with the participation of other disciplines, to create new tools that fortify investigation methods in the humanities.

It's a tremendously ambitious project. I had the pleasure of speaking to participants in the project a few weeks ago, on complexity and agent based modeling, detailing my own research and the mistakes/accomplishments I've had in trying to deal with cultural complexity in the past.  I'm pleased to say that I'll be working with these folks a bit more in this new year, though we're still in the progress of getting-to-know each other. The Hispanic Baroque, as a period, as a worldview, as Atlantic History, is brand-new territory for me. It'll be quite exciting, I think! For more on this project's Agent Modeling work, please see [this page](http://www.culturalcomplexity.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=62&Itemid=101). The model itself can be explored [here](http://www.culturalcomplexity.net/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=102). It appears tremendously interesting, and I suspect there are important insights emerging from this model. However, I would wish that there was a bit more documentation with the applet, explaining the mechanics and 'things to try'.  The model appears to be linked to this [model](http://www.culturalcomplexity.net/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=99), with the outputs of the latter becoming the inputs of the former. Are there other examples of linked agent-models out there?
