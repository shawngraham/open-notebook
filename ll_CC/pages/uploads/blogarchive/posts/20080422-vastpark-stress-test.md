# VastPark Stress Test

It's been a virtual morning. Just participated in the VastPark stress test. VastPark is a nascent virtual worlds platform - according to their material, 

> VastPark is an end-to-end solution for creating, deploying and distributing virtual experiences on the web. It's composed of a new breed of applications, designed to make creating these experiences simpler and faster, with a more immersive result. We call this the era of the _virtual web_. 
> 
> ## Powered by open specifications

> VastPark is powered by some exciting new specifications that have been developed to fulfill two of the layers in this virtual web; **MetaWSS** for content distribution and **IMML** for content presentation [Read more](http://www.vastpark.com/index.php/open-specifications/) about how VastPark is working to standardise the virtual web.

So I downloaded the alpha browser, and logged in. ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/vastpark1.jpg?w=300)The point of view was first person, mouse controls and keyboard controls for moving around. There's a chat window in the right... felt a bit like one of those VRML type sites. I couldn't connect using my poor old Toshiba laptop, but my desktop graphics card was up to the task, and connection was achieved in 5 seconds, throwing me in-world. The first world worked fine enough, second one I tried caused it to freeze up (but that may have been because the test ended right about the same time). Now, I realise that this is the alpha build, and that this was a stress test, so one shouldn't expect too much, yet (I was annoyed the way the browser grabbed my mouse, and wouldn't let me leave the world pane of the browser. Turns out you have to hit the secret key to get it to release). They've already made all of their tools [available](http://www.vastpark.com/index.php/downloads/), even at this early stage, so that's something to be commended! Check 'em out, see what you think.
