> "the audio recordings in MP3 format of a conference held at Sheffield University between the 19th and 21st of April 2006 on new technologies in history and archaeology. The papers focus on GIS; imaging and virtual restoration of historical documents; data mining; Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS); and XML technologies. The papers may be useful to researchers interested in computing in history or archaeology." Original url http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/es04papers.html
