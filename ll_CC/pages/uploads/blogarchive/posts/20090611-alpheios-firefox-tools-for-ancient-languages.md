# Alpheios - Firefox tools for Ancient Languages

... and indeed, a host of languages. From the [Alpheios](http://alpheios.net/content/alpheios-project) website: 

> The Alpheios Project's current initiatives include: \- the development of computer tools for reading classical texts and learning classical languages \- the creation of a million word treebank of classical Greek \- examples of how literary texts can be collaboratively enhanced, made more accessible to a wider variety of readers, and rendered more amenable to comparative analysis. \- examples of how computer analysis of texts and corpora can contribute to literary research and language pedagogy. We are initially focusing on the six classical languages with the most extensive literary traditions: Greek and Latin, Chinese and Sanskrit, and Arabic and Persian. Several others are under active consideration, including Akkadian, Hebrew, Pali, Avestan, Old Japanese, Old English, Old Norse, Old French, Old High German, Old Castilian and Provencal/Occitan. These may be developed as the resources for their lexical and morphological analysis become available, but we wish to point out that our programs are designed modularly to facilitate the addition of new languages with minimal effort, and all our code will be open-source to encourage others to create similar tools for their own languages.
