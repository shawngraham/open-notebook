# Immersive Worlds conference at Brock

What would you see if you looked at Second Life from an archaeological point of view? I asked myself that very question recently. Of course, one of the things you'd see is the enormous potential for education.... but, putting aside such instrumental uses of Second Life, and looking at it as a world in its own right, with its own cultures, you start to see some interesting things... [Here is the audio](http://www.coronationhall.com/of%20past%20lives%20and%20second%20lives.wav) from my presentation at Brock, 'Of Second Lives and Past Lives: Archaeological Thoughts on the Metaverse". You can hear the points where I stop to think... somewhat like the William Shatner School of Lecture... The file is in the .wav format because, for reasons unknown to me, the mp3 version would not upload.
