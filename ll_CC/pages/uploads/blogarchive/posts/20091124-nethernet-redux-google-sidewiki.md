# NetherNet Redux? Google Sidewiki

What always excited my about [The Nethernet](http://www.thenethernet.com/) (nee Pmog) was the ability to annotate websites (refugees from the Nethernet keep the flame burning [here](http://tnnrefugees.ning.com/)). So over at [Ubernoggin](http://ubernoggin.com/archives/481), I see that the Googlemonster is allowing folks to annotate websites. There's potential here. From Ubernoggin: 

> I can’t help but be excited about [Google Sidewiki](http://www.google.com/sidewiki/intl/en/index.html). It allows users (with google accounts) to leave comments on any website. So now, rather than signing up for forums and chats to comment or searching through dozens of pages to read customer feedback, you can simply click a button in your browser and see what people are saying. I could be wrong. I could be overly excited. But I can’t help feeling that this is HUGE. The whole of the web now becomes a social network. Every page can have an unbiases forum tacked on that’s viewable by anyone.

It will be interesting to see how this evolves. What was extremely cool about Nethernet, was how those annotations could be made dynamic (puzzles, explosions, you name it). Google as a game playing platform? Stranger things have happened.
