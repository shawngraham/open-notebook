# Look on thes works, ye mighty

From the [National Post](http://www.nationalpost.com), the best description of archaeology in a newspaper, ever: 

> Archaeology may be the most complicated art form created in the last 200 years, and one of the most valuable. It's an art of unending disclosure, a system of imaginative scholarship that justifies itself through unpredictable revelations.While increasingly shaped by science, archaeology retains the quality it had when it was created in the 19th century: It always tells a story.[[read the full story by Robert Fulford](http://www.nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=864004)]

I like that. Archaeology as art, archaeology as story. I'd argue that 'archaeology as game' works, too... more on that later, as time allows.
