# Still playing with historical maps into minecraft

I managed to get my map of the zone between the Hogs' back falls and Dow's Lake (nee Swamp) into Minecraft. I completely screwed up the elevations though, so it's a pretty ....interesting... landscape. I've trying again with a map of Lowertown, coupled with elevation data from a modern map. This clearly isn't ideal, as the topography of the area has changed a lot with 150 years of urbanism. But it's the best I have handy. Anyway, it's nearly been working for me. Nearly. So I provide to you the elevation and features for your own enjoyment, see if you can make 'em run with the generate_map.py script. If you get 'key errors', try editing the features file in Paint, make sure the blocks of colour are not fuzzy on the edges.
