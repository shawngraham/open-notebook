# OpenSim

For the technically-minded amongst us, why not set up your own online world with [OpenSim](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page)? By the looks of it, it is inter-operable with content created for Second Life, though I might be wrong on that. Actually, it might be a reverse-engineered version of Second Life, if the links on its main page are any guide (see for instance [this)](http://www.libsecondlife.org/wiki/Main_Page)

> "OpenSim is a BSD Licensed Open Source project to develop a functioning virtual worlds server platform capable of supporting multiple clients and servers in a heterogeneous grid structure. OpenSim is written in [C#](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm), and can run under [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) or the [Microsoft .NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net/) runtimes. OpenSim is currently in the alpha development stage, with active testing of SVN trunk versions encouraged."![](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Image:Opensim_avatar2.png)

For a fascinating look at what is going on in OpenSim, visit [Darb Dabney's Second Life GIS Blog.](http://blog.secondlifegis.com/) If it works for GIS, then archaeology should be a cinch...
