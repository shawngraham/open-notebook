# Josh Epstein on Agent Based Modeling

I met Josh Epstein a few years ago at the Congress of the Humanities.  Today, I came across this interview on youtube - a very clear introduction & discussion of model building.  I'm putting together some resources to create an agent primer; I figure this will be in it!

**[your Zodiac compatibility](#10802 "2013-09-22 00:00:40"):** Hmm it seems like your site ate my first comment (it was extremely long) so I guess I'll just sum it up what I had written and say, I'm thoroughly enjoying your blog. I too am an aspiring blog blogger but I'm still new to everything. Do you have any helpful hints for newbie blog writers? I'd certainly appreciate it.
