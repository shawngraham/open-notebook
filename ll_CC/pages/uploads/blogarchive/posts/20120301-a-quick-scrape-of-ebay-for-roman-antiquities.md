# A quick scrape of eBay for Roman Antiquities

I scraped 400 items tagged as Roman antiquities from eBay.ca today. One was going for 1.9$ million; consensus on twitter was that it was a fake. Of the rest, the combined valued was ~ $50 000. Only 188 items had more than one bid on them. That subset had a combined value of $4000, so an interesting discrepancy there. The location of the sellers was as you'd expect - USA, UK were the top two. Next up: Germany and Slovenia. So I'd keep an eye peeled on Slovenia as a conduit for illicit materials from the Balkans.

**[Paulson](#6057 "2012-03-02 21:26:22"):** As far as saving/buying on eBay goes: If you send the seller a question about an item, find another of their listings, and send the question from that item page, rather than from the one that you actually want. This will add a little bit of work for the seller, if they want to add the question/answer to the item description page that you are actually interested in. If you see an item that you want listed in auction format, send the seller a message asking if they will accept $x to end the auction early and sell the item to you. May be telling them that they would not have to wait as long to get their money (they would probably know that, but it still might help). If that does not work, use a sniping service such as Bidball.com to bid for you. It'll bid in the last few seconds, helping you to save money and avoid shill bidding. Use a site like Ebuyersedge.com to set up saved searches. You'd get an e-mail whenever a match is listed. Especially good for "Buy It Now"s priced right. If the item that you are looking for is difficult to spell, try a misspelling search site like Typojoe.com to hopefully find some deals with items that have main keywords misspelled in the title. Other interested buyers might never see them. Then, if the item is listed an auction format, after a few days of no bids (hopefully anyway) send the seller and offer to end the auction early and sell the item to you. They may worry that no one is interested, and take whatever they can get.
