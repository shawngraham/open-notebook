# Zombies in the Academy

![](http://webpages.csus.edu/~av289/zombies.PNG)Being the author of a paper called 'Osteology of the Living Dead'  (final paper of my BA), I couldn't miss the opportunity to pass this one along, could I? 
    
    
    Call for papers: book chapters for the interdisciplinary anthology
    Zombies in the Academy: living death in higher education
    
    Editors: Andrew Whelan, Chris Moore and Ruth Walker
    
    This book takes up the momentum provided by the recent resurgence of
    interest in zombie culture to explore the relevance of the zombie trope
    to discussions of scholarly practice itself. The zombie is an
    extraordinarily rich and evocative popular cultural form, and zombidity,
    zombification and necromancy can function as compelling elements in a
    conceptual repertoire for both explaining and critically
    enlivening the debates around a broad variety of cultural and
    institutional phenomena evident in the contemporary university. We
    propose to canvas a range of critical accounts of the contemporary
    university as a living dead culture. We are therefore seeking
    interdisciplinary proposals for papers that investigate the political,
    cultural, organisational, and pedagogical state of the university,
    through applying the metaphor of zombiedom to both the form and content
    of professional academic work.
    
    We invite submissions from a range of scholars - notably in cultural and
    communication studies, but also popular culture, anthropology,
    sociology, film, game and literary studies, political science,
    philosophy and education - who would be prepared to submit chapters that
    examine the zombie trope and its relation to higher education from a
    variety of perspectives.
    
    The editors of Zombies in the Academy have an agreement for
    publication with Intellect Press UK for 2012. The anthology will be
    structured in three sections around the broad general topics of:
    
    1. corporatisation, bureaucratisation, and zombification of higher
    education;
    2. technology, digital media and moribund content distribution infecting
    the university;
    3. zombie literacies and living dead pedagogies.
    
    Paper proposals that would fit into these sections would include essays
    that might:
    -- investigate the current conditions of the academy under pressure
    from the zombie processes variously described as audit
    culture or the McDonaldisation of higher education;
    -- explore the uncanny value of the figure of the zombie as a component
    in critical pedagogical accounts (zombie concepts, undead labour in
    Marxist theory etc.), including in such accounts as they are applied to
    the university itself;
    --analyse the theme of zombies and the academic gaze through the
    narratives and mechanics of particular films, games, texts or graphic
    novels;
    -- name the attenuated conditions of work in the sector with reference
    to its various forms of zombidity;
    -- evaluate the perceived decomposition of academic standards;
    -- discuss the zombie contagion model as an explanatory device for the
    circulation of content across multiple media platforms, including into
    and out of the classroom;
    -- explore pedagogical activities that use or reflect zombie content;
    -- critically investigate the rise of zombie literacies - as an
    epidemic circulated by an unthinking student horde, and/or the undead
    ivory tower itself;
    -- address the corpselike inertia and atavism of academic distinction
    and social closure (journal rankings, peer review, tenure etc.) in the
    face of the apparently lifelike models of research production
    beyond the walls of the academy;
    -- reassess the metaphor of zombiedom, considering how it can be
    construed not only as a negative critique, but also as a possibly
    desirable, advantageous or alternative adaptive strategy in academic
    contexts.
    
    Abstracts for proposed book chapters should be 1000 words. Authors are
    asked to include brief biographical details along with their proposals,
    including name, academic affiliation and previous publications.
    
    Deadline for submissions is 15th December 2010. Please select the most
