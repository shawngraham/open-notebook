# Omeka Live!

The Omeka platform has now gone live! And what is Omeka, you may ask? It is a platform for the publication of collections and exhibitions online. Eventually, the makers of Omeka, the [Centre for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/), intend to make it available online a la Wordpress, but if you've got the right system requirements on your server: ![](http://chnm.gmu.edu/images/chnm-roy.jpg)

  * Linux operating system
  * Apache server (with mod_rewrite enabled)
  * Mysql 5.0 or greater
  * PHP 5.2.x or greater
  * ImageMagick
... you can download and install it right away. I'm in the process of setting it up on a server that I have access to - it might not work, since I'm not entirely sure what I can do on that server (although it hosted both a Joomla and a Wordpress installation well enough, so I'm hopeful). The data that I intend to put up concerns the built heritage of the township that I live in. The archaeological implications are obvious, especially in terms of public archaeology. Imagine that you are working on a project in a city neighbourhood- you could use Omeka to solicit community memories much the way [this project](http://www.catawbariverdocs.com/exhibit) is doing. Or you could showcase items in your collection, like the [Object of History](http://objectofhistory.org/) site. More showcase sites are listed [here](http://omeka.org/showcase/). All of these sites have very sharp visuals and aesthetically pleasing themes, and more themes will become available as this project progresses - more [info on themes right here](http://omeka.org/blog/2008/02/15/add-to-the-omeka-themes-directory/). postscript - woops. Turns out my host doesn't run Linux, which nuked my ambitions right there. Ah well...

## Comments

**[Shawn](#480 "2008-03-14 11:07:51"):** Thanks! I took your advice, and got some space with Dreamhost - which is working, well, like a dream.

**[Tom Scheinfeldt](#422 "2008-02-27 13:07:54"):** Thanks for your post, Shawn. I know that people have had some luck running Omeka in a virtual machine on Windows. You may want to try that. Alternatively, you can run it on one of the many inexpensive shared hosting services out there. We recommend Dreamhost (http://www.dreamhost.com/) Tom Executive Producer, Omeka Managing Director, Center for History & New Media http://omeka.org http://foundhistory.org
