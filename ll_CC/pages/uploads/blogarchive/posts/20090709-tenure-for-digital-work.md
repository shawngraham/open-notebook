# Tenure for Digital Work

Now, wouldn't that be grand: tenure for digital work! Folks are working on developing guidelines for it... (now, if I could just persuade these humanities folks that there is more to digital work than databases...). Seen over at the [College Art Association](http://www.collegeart.org/news/2009/05/27/mla-and-hastac-developing-tenure-guidelines-for-digital-scholarship/)

MLA’s Information Technology Committee is developing these guides through a [wiki](http://www.philosophi.ca/pmwiki.php/Main/MLADigitalWork), which publishes both finished and in-progress work. In his article, “Tenure in a Digital Era,” Jaschik examines the many perceptions and problems at issue, including peer review; digital and print publications; and work that crosses traditional categories of research, teaching, and service.
