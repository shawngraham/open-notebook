# Text analysis of 2012 Digital Humanities Job Adverts

![wordcloud-dhjobs](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wordcloud-dhjobs.png?w=150) 2012 was a good year for hirings in the digital humanities. See for yourself at this archive of DH jobs: <http://jobs.lofhm.org/> Now: what do these job adverts tell us, if you're a graduate student trying to find your way? Next week, I'm speaking to the Underhill Graduate Students' Colloquium at Carleton University on 'Living the life electric: becoming a digital humanist'. It's broadly autobiographical in that I'll talk about my own idiosyncratic path into this field. That's quite the point: there's no firm/accepted/typical/you-ought-to-do X recipe for becoming a digital humanist. You have to find your own way, though the growing body of [courses](http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/DH_Syllabi), [books](http://dhdebates.org/), [journals](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/), [blog-o-sphere](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/) and [twitterverse](https://twitter.com/dancohen/digitalhumanities/members) certainly makes a **huge** difference. But in the interests of providing perhaps a more satisfying answer, I'll try my hand at data mining those job posts (some 150 of them) using [Voyant ](http://voyant-tools.org/)and [MALLET ](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/)to see what augurs for the future of the field. Feel free [to explore the corpus uploaded into Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=1362066156457.1522&stopList=stop.en.taporware.txt). In any graphs you produce, January is on the left, December is on the right. If you spot anything interesting/curious, let me know. ![](http://www3.carleton.ca/underhill/images/header.jpg) And, because [word counts are amazing](http://tedunderwood.com/2013/02/20/wordcounts-are-amazing/):
