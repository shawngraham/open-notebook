# R.F.Newbold, “Some social and economic consequences of the AD 64 fire at Rome”,. Latomus 33 (1974), 858-69

It's freezing rain today, and the library is over an hour to the east, over hill and under dale. If somebody had a copy of R.F.Newbold, “Some social and economic consequences of the AD 64 fire at Rome”,. _Latomus_ 33 (_1974_), 858-69 they could lend me, I'd be most appreciative...
