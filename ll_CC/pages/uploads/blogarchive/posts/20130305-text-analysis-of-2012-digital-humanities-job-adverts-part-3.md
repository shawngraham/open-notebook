# Text Analysis of 2012 Digital Humanities Job Adverts part 3

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="517"]![](http://graeworks.net/topic-model/dhjobs2012/jobs-to-topics-2012.png) Jobs cluster into six groups (colour), connected by 'topics' (largest nodes)[/caption] [Here is a zoomable pdf of the same image, for clarity](http://graeworks.net/topic-model/dhjobs2012/jobs-to-topics-2012.pdf) In this case, the two mode network of jobs to top consituent topics provides much more clarity than the graph I posted at the end of part 2, the one-mode jobs-to-jobs via shared topics. I used the java gui for MALLET, which arranges the output in a very nice hyperlinked folder, [which you may explore here.](http://graeworks.net/topic-model/dhjobs2012/output_html/all_topics.html) You can grab the CSV and the Gephi files from this directory.
