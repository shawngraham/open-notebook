# Canadians on the Nile

![](http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/42/kennedyvoyageurs2.jpg) The [first piece ](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2007/10/10/northwest-rebellion-early-stages-work-of-an-interactive-fiction-approach-to-writing-history/)of interactive fiction that I wrote (and continue to work on) puts far too many words into the mouth of Major Boulton. I need to make the conversation there far more natural - a menu system has been suggested, so I'm slowly learning how to implement that. The general idea of the piece is for it to be a one or two room rambling conversation, over the course of which, the player discovers truths about the [Northwest Rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-West_Rebellion). In the interests of overloading my work schedule, I've started working on a second piece, that isn't quite so literal. In 'Canadians on the Nile', I'm taking my [inspiration ](http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/42/kennedyvoyageurs.shtml)from the expedition to relieve General Gordon at Khartoum by using logdrivers and river men from the Ottawa Valley to Manitoba to navigate the Nile (living in the Ottawa Valley as I do, this is one of my favourite historical episodes). This one is less 'faithful' that the Northwest Rebellion, since I'm putting words into my characters' mouths that they didn't actually say...  Right now, there are two non-player characters, in the opening scene which ends with the player's enlistment. Ideally, there'd be several npcs for the player to interact with, learning the historical background, etc... and then self-contained episodes reflecting the real historical course of the expedition. Eventually. [Here](http://www.simulatinghistory.com/IF-archive/Nile.html)'s what I've got so far.  (...the though occurs: I'm a Romanist, by training... why am I not trying Roman themes...?)
