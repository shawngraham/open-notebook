# Report from CLIR on Digital Infrastructure for Classicists

![](http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub150/pub150coversml.jpg) There's a new report out today from the [Council on Library and Information Resources](http://www.clir.org/), by Alison Babeau: ["Rome Wasn't Digitized in a Day": Building a Cyberinfrastructure for Digital Classicists](http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub150abst.html). Lots of interesting stuff. I was chuffed to see a bit of work that I did with [Giovanni Ruffini](http://faculty.fairfield.edu/gruffini/) a few years ago on social networks and prosopography was examined in this report. SNA & prosopography could be a very powerful one-two punch. I've not been able to devote much energy to that field lately, but I'd be glad to help anyone who wanted to explore it. 

> p169: "While Graham and Ruffini acknowledged that most of their analysis is still fairly speculative, they also convincingly argued that the unique nature of their results derived from network analysis of ancient evidence suggests that there are many interesting avenues of future work.

Giovanni's work on the prosopography of [Byzantine Egypt](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1175608/?site_locale=en_GB) is absolutely astounding, and you really must look his work up.
