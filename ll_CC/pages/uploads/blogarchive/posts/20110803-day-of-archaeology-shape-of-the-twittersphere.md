# Day of Archaeology - Shape of The Twittersphere

![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dayofarch-tweets-detail.jpg)I used [NodeXL ](http://nodexl.codeplex.com/)to search, scrape, and collect the pattern of linkages in tweets using the [#dayofarch hashtag](http://twitter.com/#!/search/dayofarch). I then exported these to a .net file, and used [Gephi ](http://gephi.org)to visualize and study the pattern. The [dayofarchaeology_tweets](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dayofarchaeology_tweets.pdf) file is a zoomable svg/pdf showing the full pattern. There are 454 nodes (individuals) connected by 993 edges (co-mentions, links, RTs, etc). The diagram's colors indicate degree - the blacker, the higher number of connections. Top three users: lornarichardson, portableant, dayofarch. The size of the node indicates betweeness centrality - in this case, the users who tie together the twittersphere (in that they lie on top of the most paths connecting any two pairs of users). Top three: lornarichardson, cmount1, jadufton. The network diameter is 13, meaning that the longest path between any two users is 13 jumps; the average path length is about 5 jumps. I'll mull these - and other figures - in a forthcoming post. There is meaning in structure...
