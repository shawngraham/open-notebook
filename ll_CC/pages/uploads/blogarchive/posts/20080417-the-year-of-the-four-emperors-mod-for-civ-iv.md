# The Year of the Four Emperors mod for Civ IV

This little video records some of the game play in 'The Year of the Four Emperors' mod for Civ IV that I've used from time to time in my teaching. Things to watch for - the opening shows how to load the mod and get it running; 'research' can't be turned off in the game, but you can make it impossible to carry out ('gunpowder' for some reason is on the list- but it'll take ca 2600 turns to do it, by which time the game has ended); the senate takes a vote on declaring one of the contenders Emperor; towns and military units are more or less in their correct historic positions.
