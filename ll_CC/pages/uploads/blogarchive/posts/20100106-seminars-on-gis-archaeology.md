I know Luke Premo and Mark Lake have both been doing ABM work; maybe somebody could record these lectures and post them somewhere... I'm still in no danger of being anywhere near London. I've been reading around historians' use of GIS lately; I think the archaeologists are far in the lead - but there's still the problem of moving from using GIS to recognise patterns to using GIS to explain the patterns it seems to me. Of course, I'm happy to be wrong on that.
