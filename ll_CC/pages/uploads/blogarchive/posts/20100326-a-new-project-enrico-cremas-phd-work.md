# A New Project: Enrico Crema's PhD work

Through the magic of the interweb, I learn this morning of the[ PhD work of Enrico Crema](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrnerc/Enrico_R._Cremas_HomePage/HOME.html), who blogs about it at [EvolvingSpaces](http://evolvingspaces.blogspot.com/). His work 

> seeks to study the evolution of prehistoric humter-gatherer settlement pattern in Jomon Japan, to do this I'm exploring a pretty wide range of fields and topics...To list, I'm interested in Spatial Analysis, Agent Based Modelling, Human Behavioral Ecology and Dual Inheritance Theory, and more in general everything about Evolution, Space and Human Behaviour (which basically anything you can think about...)

(Enrico, my [TravellerSim](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/travellersim-growing-settlement-structures-and-territories-with-agent-based-modeling-full-text/) might be useful for you; feel free to tear it apart and use whatever's useful!) I look forward to seeing what he comes up with! Already [on his blog](http://evolvingspaces.blogspot.com/2010/03/netlogo-r-extension.html) I learned about a [plug-in for Netlogo that pushes data into the R stats package](http://netlogo-r-ext.berlios.de/), which has *got* to be much more effective that those bloody spreadsheets I've been fighting with. Anyway, one to watch!
