# test

testing something out pre>[code language="r"][/code] < means the beginning of a word. In some programs, like TextWrangler, this is used instead: 
    
    
    [code language="r"][/code]
    b
    
    so if you search for 
    
    
    
    [code language="r"][/code]<cat
    
    (or, in TextWrangler, \bcat )it will
    find "cat", "catch", and "catsup", but not "copycat", because your query
    searched for words beginning with "cat". For patterns at the end of the
    line, you would use:
    
    
    
    
    [code language="r"][/code]
