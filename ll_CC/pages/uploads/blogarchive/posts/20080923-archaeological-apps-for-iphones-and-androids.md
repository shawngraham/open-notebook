# Archaeological Apps for Iphones and Androids?

Simple question really; but I couldn't browse the i-store to find out. Are there archaeological applications available for download onto your iPhone? Next question - what about google Android and google phones? (thoughts on all that here at [wired](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/09/what-google-mus.html)). Looks as if it will be easier to develop for Android (since Apple charges $99 just to see the developer's kit). The first applications that spring to my mind are more in the public archaeology side of things - location aware applications to bring 'ancient landscapes' direct to your phone as you wander about, perhaps. For folks in the field, maybe quick recording to an online database somewhere (linking into Nabonidus or similar)? Perhaps the folks at [open archaeology](http://openarchaeology.net/) are already on the case.
