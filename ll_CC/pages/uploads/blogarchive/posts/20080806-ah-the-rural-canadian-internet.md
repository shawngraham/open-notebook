# Ah the Rural Canadian Internet...

...doesn't actually exist. At least, not for me. I've had to move from my little strip-mall office, and its cable broadband internet. No problem, thought I: I'll just put a wee office upstairs in the family cider mill, save some monthly cash. Turns out, the three wireless internet towers within a mile of my new location cannot be reached from my location, because of trees. What sort of radio waves can't penetrate a bit of foliage, I ask you. I've tried Bell mobility's wireless access card - a 'speedy' 200 kb/s does not let you get into Second Life; it barely lets you check your bank account or check your email (and it cost me over $60 for one day's test drive!). It certainly doesn't let you do anything remotely 'web 2.0'-ish. Why's that? 'Cause nobody designs sites anymore that are light. Everything must have bells, whistles, tweeters and woofers. Satellite seems to be my only option, if it'll work. Otherwise, it's dial-up for me. That'd pretty much kill my digital life; it'd certainly make the things I do, chronicled on this blog, pretty near impossible. Ah, fine print on Second Life's page: no satellite internet. Swell.

Yeah, I wish those "webmasters" would have to upload their pages on dialup, seems those of us out in the boonies are not given any consideration, If only they kept that home page light with links to the other stuff it would make life so much easer!
