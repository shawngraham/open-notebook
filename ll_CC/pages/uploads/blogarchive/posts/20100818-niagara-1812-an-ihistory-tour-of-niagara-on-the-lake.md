# Niagara 1812: An iHistory tour of Niagara on the Lake

From Kevin Kee's team at Brock U, an excellent augmented reality application for history: 

> ![](http://www.ihistorytours.com/images/ipod.png) Take a trip into the past with _Niagara 1812_. Using your iPhone, visit places and people from the War of 1812 and beyond. Choose Roam Mode, walk around one of the historic towns of Niagara, Canada, and discover the stories that lie behind the bricks and mortar. Or choose Quest Mode, and solve a centuries-old mystery in an immersive adventure. With _Niagara 1812_, you carry history with you, in the palm of your hand.

I saw a prototype of this game earlier in the year, and with the [website](http://www.ihistorytours.com/) up and running, I guess it's been launched! Having just finally purchased an iPhone, I can't wait to give this a try.Â  I like that it comes in two flavors - roam mode, and quest mode. Not everyone is up for playing AR games, so the choice is a nice usability feature. To get a sense of what the quest mode is about, go to the website and play the prologue... ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/n1812prologue.jpg?w=300)
