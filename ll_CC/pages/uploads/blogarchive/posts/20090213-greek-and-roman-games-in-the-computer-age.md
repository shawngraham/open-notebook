# Greek and Roman Games in the Computer Age

If you're going to be anywhere near Trondheim in the next while, you might want to take in '[Greek and Roman Games in the Computer Age](http://classicscomputers.wordpress.com/)'. If you go, steal all the handouts & powerpoints you can, and send them to me... I've had the pleasure of correspondence with some of the presenters, so I know it'll be a stimulating programme; I note that Caesar IV is under discussion too - I play way too much of that game... I have mused elsewhere on its possibilities as a counterfactual approach to Roman economics. Ah to be in [Trondheim ](http://www.trondheim.com/engelsk/)in February... Programme:
