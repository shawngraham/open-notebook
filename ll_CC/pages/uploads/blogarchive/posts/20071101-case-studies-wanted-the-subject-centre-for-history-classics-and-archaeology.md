# Case Studies Wanted - The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology

[The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology](http://www.hca.heacademy.ac.uk/) (of the Higher Education Academy in the UK) is looking for [case studies](http://www.hca.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/case_Studies/) \- some very interesting work is published on this site, which deserves a wide readership. From their site: 
    "Do you have good ideas at work in teaching and learning? We would like to hear from you. For every case study we publish we will give you a grant of Â£55 or a book token. There is no limit to the number you can submit."
Instructions and forms are available on their site. I'd encourage online educators especially to submit case studies of what does - and what doesn't! - work.
