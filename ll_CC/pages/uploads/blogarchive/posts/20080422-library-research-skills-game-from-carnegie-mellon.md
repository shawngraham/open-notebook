[Carnegie Mellon Libraries](http://www.library.cmu.edu/Libraries/etc/index.html) are introducing some games to help students "develop research skills through ![](http://www.library.cmu.edu/Libraries/etc/game2/card2_descrip.gif) entertaining and easy-to-repeat activities. At this stage, we are testing each game to work through any technical glitches and prepare the games for a final version. Please feel free to send us your comments & suggestions on ways that we can further develop the games."
