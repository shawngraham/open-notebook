# Blogging Archaeology: Remembering that we've been here before when we ask 'Where to next?' 

![](http://middlesavagery.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/blogging_archaeology.jpg?w=500&h=71) For the last of Blogging Archaeology (on Twitter under [#blogarch](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23blogarch)), [Colleen](http://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/2011/03/22/blogging-archaeology-week-4/#comments) asks: 

> For our last question, I would like to ask you to consider the act of publication for this blog carnival. How could we best capture the interplay, the multimedia experience of blogging as a more formalized publication? What would be the best outcome for this collection of insights from archaeological bloggers?

The relationship between blogging and other academic forms of discourse is certainly in the aether right now. One need only look at ['Hacking the Academy](http://hackingtheacademy.org/)' or Ian Bogost's thoughts on '[Beyond Blogs](http://www.bogost.com/blog/beyond_blogs.shtml)' to see that we archaeo-bloggers are not alone in considering these questions. For me, right now at where I am in my career, the best outcome of this rich back-and-forth we've been having is some sort of refereed publication. Some time ago, [Tom Scheinfeldt](http://www.foundhistory.org/2010/05/27/new-wine-in-old-skins-why-the-cv-needs-hacking/) of the CHNM suggested that all of us digitally inclined folks should start producing digital cvs ([excellent example of which is here](http://www.crymble.ca/adam/cv/) . In response to Tom's argument, Adam Crymble [wrote](http://www.foundhistory.org/2010/05/27/new-wine-in-old-skins-why-the-cv-needs-hacking/#comment-9836), "The vulnerable have to eat, so they have to play the game. The strong can change the rules."  I think we #blogarchers have an opportunity to try to change the rules, but I think too that we are all of us vulnerable: and so what would secure us is if we can fit this new medium of expression into the safe boxes required by our annual assessments - hence a refereed publication, knowing full well how awkward that would be to produce. That said, were I invulnerable, what might I do? Well, I think I might recycle an [olde post](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/publish-your-excavation-in-minutes/#comments) here. In that post, I talk about [Anthologize](http://anthologize.org/), a wordpress plugin for turning blogged content into the safer, more comfortable multi-authored volume.  And then maybe look at releasing it via [Kindle Singles](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=2486013011)? For an aborted attempt at putting individual blog posts together into a quasi-referred quarterly publication, see [here ](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/the-past-discussed-quarterly/)and [here ](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2008/02/15/the-pdq-a-new-journal-bridging-blogging-and-academia/)on 'PDQ - The Past Discussed Quarterly. Maybe an idea whose time has finally come? A number of us were involved in that project, but given where we all were (and the various stages of our careers and lives), we couldn't make it work.  Here was our optimistic blurb:![](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/files/2008/02/pdq-link.jpg)

> From the official website: “[PDQ is a journal](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/) designed to provide a bridge between blogging and academia. It will provide stable citeable references for selected weblog posts focussed upon or of interest to the pre-Renaissance past. It is compiled from articles submitted by bloggers on a quarterly basis. [The journal is available in three formats.](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/list-of-editions/) There is a PDF downloadable copy for free. There is a paper copy which can be ordered via Lulu, which is set to the cost of printing and delivery only. Finally we intend that the journal will also be placed in a repository for long-term curation. Until the details are finalised it will be available in XHTML format from a server based at NYU’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. PDQ is released under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND licence, making it freely copyable."
