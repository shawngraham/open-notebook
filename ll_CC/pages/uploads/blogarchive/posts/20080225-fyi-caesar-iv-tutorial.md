# FYI - Caesar IV tutorial

A tutorial covering just about everything related to scenario building in Caesar IV may be found [here.](http://caesar4.heavengames.com/gameinfo/editor) My ambition is to create a [Forum Novum](http://www.bsr.ac.uk/bsr/sub_arch/extra/BSR_Tiber_Forum01.htm) scenario, with as close as an approximation to real Roman economic realities built in as possible... postscript: A small program for checking your scenario for errors is available from [this thread](http://www.tiltedmill.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13202) (scroll down). It checks for the following: 

> "When you load a scenario, it will check for these things: \- factories that are missing raw materials \- missing natural resources such as clay pits and iron mines \- resources that are available but can never be used \- resources that can be exported but are not available \- requests for unavailable goods \- scenario goals that cannot be achieved, including building and resource goals, and prosperity and culture rating goals It will attempt to load the XML file and check some more things: \- missing keys for empire level cities, requests and goals \- wrong values for rating goals In addition to this, it will show you: \- Maximum level that housing can attain (housing tab) \- The number of available foods and basic/luxury/exotic goods (housing tab) \- A list of all used resources, including their total import/export amounts and trade prices (resources tab) \- A list of trade cities with what they buy and sell, including the route type (water/land), cost to open, and their ID in the scenario (handy for writing the XML file) (trade routes tab)"

Handy, that!
