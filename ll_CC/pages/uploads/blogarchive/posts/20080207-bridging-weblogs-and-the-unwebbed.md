# Bridging weblogs and the unwebbed

Alun Salt has touched off a [very interesting discussion over on the Ancient World Bloggers Group](http://ancientworldbloggers.blogspot.com/2008/02/re-thinking-blog-carnival.html ) on 'blog carnivals' and self-publishing via services like Lulu. He writes, 

> "The exciting thing about these books is that they provide material in a form that’s citable in front of a technophobic audience. You can simply cite Author, date, Title, and Lulu.com as the publisher. This may get sniffs from people who would call this vanity publishing, but would be happy supplying camera-ready copy and their own referees to a ‘respectable’ publisher. You can’t have everything and for everyone else it provides a canonical reference to cite. Importantly to the reader this e-book can be provided at zero-cost, and for the publisher it is lo-cost or no-cost. If this approach were applied to blog carnivals, it would be possible to create a periodical available as a CC licenced e-book and a hardcopy with ISSNs. This would provide canonical citations for blog posts which for various reasons haven’t been re-written for academic journals. Could this be used to create a bridge between weblogs and the unwebbed?"

I especially like his thought, later on, that weblogs represent a sort of on-going conference than a kind of journalism. Anyway, scroll down and read the comments on Alun's posting. His idea seems to have really caught on!
