# ANGEL LMS @ U Manitoba

This term, we switched to Angel. Training was offered, but only to those in Manitoba; those of us who teach online, were left to sort things out for ourselves. Right now, I have two major complaints - the length of time it takes for anything to load (seems to be very AJAX heavy, though I believe I'm right in thinking that that shouldn't really be a problem), and the course discussion area tells me thatÂ  I have one unread post, but when I click on that, it tells me it can't find it! I hate feeling like a newb. Oh, ok, a third complaint - if I post resources into Angel, and then later decide to delete said resource, the navigation tree keeps the deleted resource, and I start to get caught in nested loops of pages. Just like, in fact, old websites that relied on frame-based navigation, where you could navigate to a second frame-based site, and then back again, and so on, and so on, diminishing each window as you went... I hated [WebCT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCT); I'm having doubts about [Angel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANGEL_Learning). At least I knew what was going on with [Moodle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moodle).
