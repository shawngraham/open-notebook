# A Tribute to the Rolling Boulder

So I downloaded the game, 'A Tribute to the Rolling Boulder' - see previous post. I obviously have some ambivalence about my chosen profession. Who knew that squishing archaeologists could be so much fun? Especially when you get two at once, and they scream... This'll be a classic amongst archaeology students the world over, I should think. As if I didn't need more distractions. ![bouldergame.jpg](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/bouldergame.jpg)
