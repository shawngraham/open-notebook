# SL_Archaeology (or, the virtual excavation update 4)

I recently posted a query on the [Second Life Educator's list](http://www.google.com/cse?cx=001010425210852223575%3Ajldmgpuier0&q=archaeology&sa=Search&cof=FORID%3A0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) explaining what I was up to, and, in the interests of not reinventing the wheel, whether anything similar has been done. I received a number of notes from people with suggestions of approaches to try, and examples of other archaeologically-themed sims, chief amongst them [Okapi Island](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Okapi/128/128/0) (read about opportunities for [apprenticeships](http://okapi.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/okapi-island-in-second-life-opportunities-for-students-and-others-spring-2008/) here!) and Indiana University of Pennsylvania's [Crimson Island](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Crimson%20Island/55.5898/146.573). Thank you so much! (By the way, there is a session titled '[Current Experiments in Interpretation](http://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/2008/01/22/wac-2008-call-for-participation/)' at this year's World Archaeological Conference that should be of interest to readers of this blog.) An [interesting approach](https://lists.secondlife.com/pipermail/educators/2008-January/018065.html) was suggested to me by Paula Christopher at Georgia State. Using simple box-prims layered on on top of the other displaying the 'texture' (picture) I want to show for each layer, she suggests putting a show/hide script in each prim. That way, the student can touch each layer, and have it 'excavated' away to reveal the layer below. This I think might be a 'safer' way of doing it than what I've been trying this past week: I had noticed, inadvertently, that I could lose prims 'underground'. I could only recover them by using the land tool to lower the ground, exposing the prim. This gave me an 'ah ha!' moment. I rezzed the simple cabin that comes with every avatar's inventory on a piece of ground that I had lowered to just above the level of the ur-ocean that underlays every piece of land in SL. I then unlinked all of its component prims, and made them all 'physical'. They collapsed according to SL's physics engine, making a pile of beams, etc. I then made them all 'normal' again ie they don't move unless you use the repositioning tool. At this point, I raised the land around the prims as unevenly as I could, making sure to make the land a bit bumpy over the long walls and so on - site formation processes in SL! Then, a few bits of grass and other bits of greenery, placed to mimic growth over an archaeological site, salt with web-linked prims to archaeological databases, and voila. The flaw in this plan, is that in order to excavate, I would have to turn over permissions to alter the landscape to my students. Maybe that's not an issue, but on reflection I can think of one or two ways that that could go horribly wrong. That's why I think I'll redo this show/hide prims rather than the actual landscape of SL. ![step-one-destory-a-building1.jpg](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/step-one-destory-a-building1.thumbnail.jpg)![rwu-virtual-site-2.jpg](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/rwu-virtual-site-2.thumbnail.jpg)
