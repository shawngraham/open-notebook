# Text Analysis of 2012 Digital Humanities Job Adverts part 2

![digital-humanities-jobs](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/digital-humanities-jobs1.png?w=150)If we look at simple word frequencies in the[ 2012 job advertisement document](http://jobs.lofhm.org/)s for Digital Humanities, we find these top words and raw frequency counts: research    650 university    577 experience    499 library            393 work            334 information    303 position    299 project            269 applications    257 (I've deleted 'digital' and 'humanities' from this list). If job advertisements are a way of signalling what an institution hopes the future will hold, one gets the sense that the focus of digital humanities work will be on projects, on research, in conjunction with libraries. But we can extract more nuance, using network analysis. You can feed the texts into [Voyant's 'RezoViz' too](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/tools/rezoviz/)l, which extracts paired nouns in each document. This can be outputted as a [.net](https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/pajek-net-format/) file, and then imported into [Gephi](http://gephi.org). The resulting graph has 1461 nodes, and 20649 edges. Of course, there are some duplicates (like 'US' and 'United States'), but this is only meant to be rough and ready, '[generative](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/11/discovery-and-justification-are-different-notes-on-sciencing-the-humanities/)', as it were (and note also that a _network visualization is not necessary_ for the analysis. So no spaghetti balls. What's important are the metrics). What I'd like to find out are what concepts are doing the heavy lifting in these job advertisements? What is the hidden structure of the future of digital humanities, as evidenced by job advertisements in the English speaking world? My suspicion is that 'modularity' aka 'community detection', and 'betweeness centrality', are going to be the key metrics for figuring this out. [Modularity ](http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Modularity)groups nodes on the basis of shared similar local patternings of ties (or, to put it another way, it decomposes the global network into maximal subnetworks).[ Seth Long recently did some network analysis on the Unabomber's manifesto](http://technaverbascripta.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/text-network-and-corpus-analysis-of-the-unabomber-manifesto/), and lucidly explains why betweeness centrality is a useful metric for understanding semantic meaning: "A word with high betweenness centrality is a word through which many meanings in a text circulate." In other words, the heavy lifters. So let's peer into the future. I ended up with about 15 groups. The first three groups by modularity account for 75% of the nodes, and 80% of the ties. These are the groups where the action lies. So let's look at words with the highest betweenness centrality scores for those first three groups. 

### The first group

_University_ _ CSS_ _ PHP_ _ Digital_ _ Ruby_ _ METS (Metadata encoding and transmission standard)_ _ United States_ _ Python_ _ MLS_ _ New York_ 'University' is not surprising, and not useful. So let us discard it and bring in the next highest word: _MySQL_ This one group by modularity also has all of the highest betweenness centrality scores - and it reads like a laundry list of the skills a budding DH practitioner must hold. The US, and New York would seem to be the centre of the world, too. If we take the next ten words, we get: _MODS (Netadata Object Description Schema)_ _ XHTML_ _ University Libraries_ _ CLIR (Council on Library and Information Resources)_ _ University of Alberta_ _ North America_ _ Drupal_ _ XML_ _ MARC_ _ Duke University_ Again, skills and places figure - in Canada, U of A appears. So far, the impression is that DH is all about text, markup, and metadata. Our favorite programming languages are python and ruby. We use php, xhtml, xml, and drupal (plain-jane vanilla html eventually turns up in the list, but it's buried very, very deep.). So that's an impression of the first group. (Remembering that groups are defined by patterns of similarity in their linkages). 

### The Second Group

The next group looks like this: _ Digital Humanities_ _ London_ _ UK_ _ CV_ _ Dublin_ _ Europe_ _ Ireland_ _ ICT_ _ Department of Digital Humanities_ _ Department of History_ "digital humanities" is probably not helpful, so let's eliminate that and go one more down: "US". Indeed, let's take a look at the next ten, too: _Human Resources_ _ Department_ _ Computer Science_ _ BCE_ _ Head of School_ _ Faculty of Humanities_ _ European_ _ University of Amsterdam_ _ MA_ _ Italy_ Here, we're dealing very much with a UK, Ireland, and European focus. The 'BCE' is telling, for it suggests an archaeological focus in there, somewhere (unless this is some new DH acronym of which I'm not aware; I'm assuming 'before the common era'). 

### The Third Group

In the final group we'll consider here, we find a strong Canadian focus: _CRC (Canada Research Chair)_ _ Canada_ _ Waterloo_ _ TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)_ _ SSHRC_ _ Victoria_ _ Canada Research Chair_ _ Skype_ _ Digital Humanities Summer Institute_ _ University of Victoria_ Since we've got some duplication in here, let's look at the next ten: _Canadian_ _ Quebec_ _ ETCL (Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory, U Victoria)_ _ Montreal_ _ Concordia_ _ University of Waterloo_ _ DHSI (Digital Humanities Summer Institute)_ _ Stratford_ _ Faculty of Arts_ _ Stratford Campus_ 'Canada Research Chairs' are well-funded government appointments, and so give an indication of where the state would like to see some research. Victoria continually punches above its weight, with look ins from Waterloo and Concordia. **So what have we learned? **Well, despite the efforts of the digital history community, 'digital humanities' is still largely a literary endeavor - although it's quite possible that a lot of the marking up that these job advertisements might envision could be of historical documents. Invest in some python skills (see [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org)). My friends in government tell me that if you can data mine, you'll be set for life, as the government is looking for those skills. (Alright, that didn't come out in this analysis at all, but he's looking over my shoulder right now). Finally - London, Dublin, New York, Edmonton, Victoria, Waterloo, Montreal - these seem to be the geographic hotspots. Speaking of temperature, Victoria has the nicest weather. Go there, young student! Or come to Carleton and study with me.  We've got tunnels.
