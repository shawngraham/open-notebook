# Open Access Supervising

I've recently taken on a 4th year Interdisciplinary Studies student for his honours thesis. He's interested in social aspects of drinking in the Aegean Bronze Age. It's been a while since I've dabbled in the Aegean, but this should be an interesting experience. Zack's research blog [may be followed here](http://zackbatist.com/). If you have an interest in the area/subject, feel free to follow along. I think I'll post about my perspective on Zack's research from time to time - hence the title of this post. But as Ethan Watrall [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/Captain_Primate), there are of course privacy concerns. So I'll limit myself to big-picture idea type posts. One of Zack's interests is in digital approaches to archaeology. We want the tools/methods to suit the questions (or be able to shed new light on old questions), so we're reading around some digital work in Classics and Archaeology, for inspiration:

Should be a lot of fun. We're setting up a digital workflow. I'm asking Zack to blog about his research - what he's reading, the questions those readings raise, the problems he encounters. By getting into the habit of writing in small chunks frequently, my hope is that he'll be able to pull together substantial pieces for the eventual submission. Each chunk can then be arranged/tweaked in [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivenerforwindows/), until we're happy with the logic and flow. With [Zotero ](http://zotero.org)to manage bibliography and [Evernote ](http://evernote.com)to keep track of ideas/thoughts/interesting tidbits, Zack will learn how to get the most out of his research process.
