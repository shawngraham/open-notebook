# Report on the Greek and Roman Games in the Computer Age Conference, Trondeheim, Norway

From Andrew Reinhard, [a report](http://eclassics.ning.com/profiles/blogs/report-on-the-greek-and-roman) on the recent short conference detailing the nascent Classicists-discover-computer-games movement: 

> A revolution is happening now and the flashpoint is Scandinavia. Both Sweden and Norway have fought and won to keep Classics as a vital and viable subject of study at the secondary school and university level. Activist bloggers like Moa Ekbom in Sweden (see her [Latinblogg](http://latinblogg.blogspot.com/)), and activist students like Magnus Eriksson in Norway have been responsible for rescuing canceled Classics programs while at the same time finding ways to resuscitate Classics, promoting and publicizing both Latin and Greek as important for contemporary audiences, not just relating to scholarship, but also to popular culture, stripping the stigma of elitism from Classics and proving that Classical Studies is indeed essential for anyone. The [Greek and Roman Games in the Computer Age conference](http://classicscomputers.wordpress.com/) was organized by Classics professors Thea Selliaas Thorsen and Staffan Wahlgren, both of the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](http://www.ntnu.no/historie/english) just outside of [Trondheim](http://www.trondheim.no/), Norway. The first of its kind, this conference sought to survey Classics in computer games and virtual worlds as presented by fifteen speakers from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Another series of blog posts from the conference floor [live here](http://latinblogg.blogspot.com/2009/03/finis-ludorum.html). I look forward to future iterations of this conference, and hope they come to this side of the pond so I stand a chance of attending.
