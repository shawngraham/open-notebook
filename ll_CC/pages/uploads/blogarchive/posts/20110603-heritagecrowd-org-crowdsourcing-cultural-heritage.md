# HeritageCrowd.org: crowdsourcing cultural heritage

I have a small summer project running, using the [Ushahidi ](http://ushahidi.com)and [Omeka ](http://omeka.org)platforms for crowdsourcing local history, called [HeritageCrowd](http://heritagecrowd.org). I have two [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca) undergraduate students, Guy Massie and Nadine Feuerherm helping me with this; we're blogging the experience [here](http://heritagecrowd.org/journal). Please check us out; comments & critiques (and submissions, of course!) are most welcome. Guy writes, 

> This project, headed by Professor Shawn Graham and students Nadine Feuerherm and Guy Massie at Carleton University, rethinks the way that people share and interact with local history and heritage. Through the use of a number of technologies such as text messaging, voice mail, and the internet, we will test the possibility for creating a database of local history knowledge by asking for contributions from the community. This type of approach is known as "[crowdsourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing)," and while it has been used to gather information about ongoing events such as the violence following the 2008 elections in Kenya, it has yet to be used in this way in the area of heritage and local history. The contributions made to the project will be stored and displayed on a website for the public. On our '[stories](http://heritagecrowd.org/stories/)' page, students and researchers can do further research on the items contributed by the public, creating exhibitions and other digital stories. In the same way that the [Memory Project](http://www.thememoryproject.com/) is working to record the stories of veterans from the Second World War, we believe that there is an untapped resource in the historical knowledge of members from the community. The different ways of contributing to this project mean that anyone with telephone or internet access can share what they know about a place, event, building, or other topic related to local history. Our goal is to create an automated method of storing and digitally curating local heritage and history. In this way, our research hopes to benefit rural areas, and other regions of the world, that may otherwise face obstacles in attracting interest and attention about local history from the larger public. This project is funded by aÂ Junior Research Fellowship, and will make extensive use of the Omeka and Ushahidi web-based platforms. It will use the Upper Ottawa Valley as a "testing ground" for the project, and in particular the Pontiac MRC region in Western Quebec.
