# On Public Access to Digital Data: Mining Public Comment

Yesterday, Bethany suggested that the public comments on the [American OSTP request for info regarding public access to digital data](http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/library/digitaldata) would be a good target for some data mining: [tweet https://twitter.com/#!/nowviskie/statuses/164509026225364993] So, I downloaded the pdf and turned it into plain text. I did not do any cleanup; what follows is a brief look at large-scale patterns, with all the caveats and cautions that that implies. I loaded the raw txt into Voyant Tools, where one can do some initial frequency counts and so on - [available here](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=1328107738300.4562). (NB - the corpus reader tool does not seem to work from this link; but all other Voyant tools do. You may also upload the txt file yourself into Voyant, which may solve the corpus reader problem - the txt is available in the zip file below). Then, as is often my wont, I topic modeled it by individual line (for 25 topics). Below are the raw topics w/o interpretation. I also mapped the topics to their documents using Gephi. As there were >30 000 lines, I pruned to show just the lines where an individual topic accounted for more than 2/3rds of its composition (and joining it to its minor topics). I ran the modularity routine to determine 'communities' within those comments; gephi suggests 15 communities. The communities centered on 15, 9, and 23 seem to be most prominent. Here are all my data files [(zipped download, ca. 46mb; includes gephi files)](http://graeworks.net/topic-model/miningpubliccomment.zip). What does this all mean? I'll leave it to the reader to decide that for herself. [Larger screenshot](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=1330).Â  (scroll to bottom for update).

**[Elijah](#5744 "2012-02-02 11:57:05"):** What an awesome thing to do.

**[Shawn](#5725 "2012-02-01 11:50:19"):** PS - Just noticed that one of my output files from my previous post on playing with Play the Past found its way into the zip. Enjoy that too! But object lesson: develop good naming conventions and archiving strategies, and stick to 'em!

**[info](#18865 "2014-02-28 10:01:22"):** Nature Spirits Mer-people, air and water beings who are concerned with spring rains and storms. Why not ask your partner to help stimulate your mental libido by talking to you during sex.
