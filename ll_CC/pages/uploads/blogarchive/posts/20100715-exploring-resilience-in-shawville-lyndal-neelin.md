# Exploring Resilience in Shawville - Lyndal Neelin

In the Canadian Studies department at Carleton, [Lyndal Neelin](http://www.blogger.com/profile/05993063875079794404) is studying t[he anglophones of Shawville Quebec](http://shawvillestudy.blogspot.com/). Being one of those myself, I thought I'd highlight Lyndal's study & blog here, in the hopes of reaching more of Shawville's Diaspora. After the mines closed in the 70s, and the PQ came to power, there was quite a substantial exodus of talent and resources; Lyndal's study examines how the community responds and recovers from that. Shawville [is sometimes still a target](http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=shawville+flq&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Search+Archives) for some of the more extreme fringes of the separatist movement.
