# New ABM papers to read

Just seen, and on my list to read: Tubaro, P., & Casilli, A. A. (2010). ”An Ethnographic Seduction”: How Qualitative Research and Agent-based Models can Benefit Each Other Bulletin de Méthodologie Sociologique, 106 (1), 59-74 DOI: [10.1177/0759106309360111 ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0759106309360111)

> A new article has just come out, co-authored with Antonio Casilli on ‘[‘An Ethnographic Seduction’’: How Qualitative Research and Agent-based Models can Benefit Each Other](http://bms.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/106/1/59). We propose a new form of mixed method for the social sciences, combining ethnographic research and agent-based computer simulation.

from[ Tubaro's blog](http://paolatubaro.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/an-ethnographic-seduction/). Also, from Paul Torrens, [Agent-based Models and the Spatial Sciences](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123417042/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0): 

> [...] Geographers' work with ABMs has helped to strengthen existing ties with related disciplines such as computer science and informatics, ecology, sustainability science, economics, anthropology, political science and the earth sciences. Primarily because of the value placed on spatial science and behavioral geography in agent-based modeling, work of this kind is helping to infuse geographical perspectives and 'spatial thinking' into these fields. This article reviews the development of agent-based modeling in the spatial sciences, its current uses and applications in physical and human geography and potential future trends in its research and development.

And reviews from the [Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html):
