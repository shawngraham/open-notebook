# My Bacon Number is 3; My Wheeler Number is 4

I'm writing a lecture on social network analysis for one of my classes. I thought it would be good to illustrate some of the features of networks with reference to the parlour game, '[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)' - and then remembered that I had once been an extra in a film. Perhaps I too had a Bacon Number? [H20 ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2O_%28miniseries%29#Cast)was a miniseries starring [Paul Gross](http://paulgross.org). It was filmed in Ottawa in the winter of 2004. I thought it would be fun to see how tv movies get made, so I auditioned and got a few days of extra work. Most of the time, it was as a face in the crowd. But once - once! my big break! look ma! - I got to be in a scene with one of the principles (I saw Paul Gross once in the hallway of the [Chateau Laurier](http://www.fairmont.com/laurier), where we were filming, but that doesn't seem enough for my purposes today). The principle was [Yves Jacques](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0415191/), who was playing the premier of Quebec. If you watch the film, you can see me nod and answer the phone. 2 seconds of cinematic glory. But sufficient to generate a Bacon number (from the [Oracle of Bacon](http://oracleofbacon.org), more or less, since us extras aren't in the database): Shawn Graham was in [H20 (2004) ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410055/fullcredits#cast)with[ Yves Jacques](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Jacques,+Yves) who was in[ Michael Kael contre la World News Company (1998)](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Michael+Kael+contre+la+World+News+Company+%281998%29) with[ Elliott Gould](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Gould,+Elliott) who was in [The Big Picture (1989)](http://www.imdb.com/Title?The+Big+Picture+%281989%29) with[ Kevin Bacon](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Bacon,+Kevin) Perhaps we need an archaeological equivalent. What's your [Wheeler ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_Wheeler)Number? How many steps to the icon? [Michael Fulford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fulford) was one of my supervisors; Fulford worked for [Barry Cunliffe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Cunliffe), [who studied](http://beta.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/interview-professor-barry-cunliffe-video) with [Glyn Daniel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyn_Daniel) ; Daniel was a host of the game show _[Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?_](http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Animal,_Vegetable,_Mineral) along with Mortimer Wheeler (in 1971, Cunliffe also hosted).... making my Wheeler Number 4. (or 3, depending on whether or not Cunliffe co-hosted with Wheeler in 1971). Of course, it might be more ...academic... to look at citations and co-authorships, but somehow it's more satisfying to know that a game show figures in this linkage.

**[Kristina Killgrove (@BoneGirlPhD)](#4911 "2011-09-10 15:41:52"):** My husband actually runs the Oracle of Bacon, so I know for a fact that all we need for an Oracle of Wheeler (or perhaps Oracle of Binford or Oracle of Boas in the US?) is a database. Are you offering to set one up? :)
