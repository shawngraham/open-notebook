# Immersive Worlds Conference

I'll be speaking at the [Immersive Worlds](http://www.brocku.ca/iasc/immersiveworlds/index.php) Conference at Brock University, on 'Immersive Archaeology'... or something similar. Haven't settled on a title yet. Some interesting work done in that field by the people at the [University of North Dakota](http://fishhook.ndsu.edu/home/).
