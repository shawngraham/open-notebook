# Publishing Archaeology

Quick note: I just came across Michael Smith's excellent blog, '[Publishing Archaeology](http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/)'.  Today's [post](http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-archaeologists-need-to-publish.html), about how archaeological data is ignored or subverted by scholars in other fields,  so archaeologists need to publish outside the archaeological journals to fight this, is fantastic. Go explore his blog now!
