# Google Wave & Archaeology

I've been involved with a couple of projects now, where the emails, the documentation, the whiteboards, the databases all morphed into a huge ugly monster. O Google, What Can Thou Doest About This? [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDu2A3WzQpo&feature=player_embedded] From [the horse's mouth](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html#video). Wired had a very good story about it, but darned if I can find it now. But if it works as well as the video suggests it ought to (a big if)... big collaborative research projects ought to get a whole lot easier... Perhaps.
