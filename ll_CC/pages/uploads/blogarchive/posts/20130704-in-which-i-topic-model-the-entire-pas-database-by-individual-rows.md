# In which I topic model the entire PAS database by individual rows

Previously, I was trying to consider the geography of Roman Britain as a corpus of documents - individual geographic (modern) areas - where the records in the Portable Antiquities Scheme database formed the words of the document. Today, I inverted that process. I treated each individual row in the entire PAS database as an individual document, with the data within that record its words. It took about two hours of processing time, looking for 100 topics. I now have a series of outputs that neither Excel nor Notepad++ can open, as they are too big. I'll have to break the files up before I can dig too much deeper into them. However, what I can examine seems promising - topics that seem to indicate various regions; topics that indicate particular finds officers; topics that indicate particular kinds of artefacts; topics that indicate the status of the object (whether it was returned to the finder). Here's a sampling:
