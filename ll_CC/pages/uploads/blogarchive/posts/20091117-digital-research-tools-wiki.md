# Digital Research Tools Wiki

I came across the [DiRT](http://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/) page this morning, run by Lisa Spiro. What an awesome resource! If you know of tools that are useful in your own research, suggest them to Lisa and get them listed on this page. From the front: 

> This wiki collects information about tools and resources that can help scholars (particularly in the humanities and social sciences) conduct research more efficiently or creatively.  Whether you need software to help you manage citations, author a multimedia work, or analyze texts, Digital Research Tools will help you find what you're looking for. We provide a directory of tools organized by research activity, as well as reviews of select tools in which we not only describe the tool's features, but also explore how it might be employed most effectively by researchers. **Please provide** **[feedback**](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pAlYM7vZmTy_raf4RE3Mzcg) **on DiRT and** **[recommend tools**](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pAlYM7vZmTy_raf4RE3Mzcg) not included here (yet). If you're interested in contributing to this wiki, please email Lisa Spiro at [lspiro@rice.edu](mailto:lspiro@rice.edu).  Please see [Guidelines for Contributors](http://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/Guidelines-for-Contributors) to learn how to add new information to the wiki.

I love how it is organized by asking what it is you want to do.  While focussed on the humanities and social sciences, there is a distinct lack of Agent Modeling or other simulation tools, which I suppose indicates that simulation hasn't made great inroads amongst the digital humanities set yet. Some great dynamic map tools though! 

 

  * [ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/index.html): "an integrated collection of GIS software products that provides a standards-based platform for spatial analysis, data management, and mapping" (Commercial, Windows)

You can explore rich geographical content, save your toured places, and share with others." (Free, with Pro version available; PC/Mac/Linux)
  * [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/): allows you to view maps and directions, with practical applications for transportation and diverse viewing options to further specify location (Free, web-based)

## Comments

**[Lisa Spiro](#2419 "2009-11-18 12:14:56"):** Thanks for the comments about DiRT, Shawn! We'd love to add a section about simulation and agent modeling tools. Please let me know if there are specific tools you would suggest--or, better yet, if you'd like to edit a section of DiRT devoted to simulation.
