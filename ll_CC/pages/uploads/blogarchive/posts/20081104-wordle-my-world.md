# Wordle my world

Clearly too much time on my hands: I just ran this blog through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net), and got [the following](http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/288503/Electric_Archaeology). Does it mean anything? Well, wordle uses the number of times a word appears in a text as a guide to its relative size and placement, so these word clouds do give a handy visual impression of what a text is about - which would suggest that this blog is more about games than archaeology... hmmm. ![](http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/288503/Electric_Archaeology) Postscript: I enjoyed playing with Wordle so much, I ran the text of my article on simulating the diffusion of information throughout the Roman empire (JMA 19.1) through wordle too, and much to my delight, it produced a word cloud from the article that looks for all the world like, well, an itinerary! [Big version here](http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/288512/Antonine_Itineraries_JMA_19.1).![](http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/288512/Antonine_Itineraries_JMA_19.1) I'd run my thesis through it, but that just might be silly.
