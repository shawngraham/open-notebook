# Historypin - another augmented reality app

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdT3eKdto4w&feature=player_embedded] This is a very slick interface, combining historical photos, the stories behind them, and Google Maps / Street View. None so far in Canada though.

**[Jeff Underwood](#3362 "2010-06-10 16:41:12"):** I hope you’re as enthusiastic about Historypin as we are and you’re keen to be part of this ambitious project. If you are, but perhaps you don’t have access to a scanner or perhaps have too many photos to scan. If so, we can help. 1Scan.co.uk is Historypin’s offical scanning partner. You can read more about what we do at http://1scan.co.uk/historypin/historypin.htm If you’d like us to scan your photos we are offering a 10% discount if you mention this blog.
