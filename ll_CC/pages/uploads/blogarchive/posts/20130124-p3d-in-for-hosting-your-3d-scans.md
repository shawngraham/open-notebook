# p3d.in for hosting your 3d scans

I'm playing with [p3d.in](http://p3d.in/u/shawngraham) to host some three dimensional models I've been making with [123D Catch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch). These are models that I have been using in conjunction with [Junaio ](http://www.junaio.com/)to create augmented reality pop-up books (and other things; more on that anon). Putting these 3d objects onto a webpage (or heaven forbid, a pdf) has been strangely much more complicated and time-consuming. P3d.in then serves a very useful purpose then! Below are two models that I made using 123D catch. The first is the end of a log recovered from anaerobic conditions at the bottom of the Ottawa River (which is very, very deep in places). The Ottawa was used as a conduit for floating timber from its enormous watershed to markets in the US and the UK for nearly two hundred years. Millions of logs floated down annually.... so there's a lot of money sitting down there. A local company,[ Log's End](http://www.logsend.com/), has been recovering these old growth logs and turning them into high-end wide plank flooring. They can't use the ends of the logs as they are usually quite damaged, so my father picked some up and gave them to me, knowing my interest in all things stamped. This one carries an S within a V, which dates it to the time and timber limits of J.R. Booth I believe. ![logend-edit2 \(Click to view in 3D\)](http://p3d.in/model_data/snapshot/YMywt) And here we have one of the models that my students made last year from the Mesoamerican materials conserved at the Canadian Museum of Civilization (soon-to-be-repurposed as the Museum of Canadian History; what will happen to these awkward materials that no longer fit the new mandate?) ![mesoamerican \(Click to view in 3D\)](http://p3d.in/model_data/snapshot/zwPEM) PS Incidentally, I've now embedded these in a [Neatline ](http://neatline.org/)exhibition I am building: [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="382"]![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BBZcWVOCUAEciz7.png:large) 3d manipulable objects in time and space[/caption]
