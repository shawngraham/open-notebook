# The Archaeological Blogosphere

![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/the-archaeological-blogosphere1.png?w=214)The [archaeological blogosphere](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/the_archaeological_blogosphere.pdf) [zoomable pdf of image] is strangely beautiful. I generated this by scraping over 8000 pages from a Google Search of 'Blogging Archaeology'. [MiddleSavagery ](http://middlesavagery.wordpress.com)sits right there in the middle of the Green Zone. For more on this, and what it means, see my discussion tomorrow at the Society for American Archaeology's general meeting. If you'd like to play with the files and data I scraped send me a note.Â  You'll need Gephi. To do your own crawling, you [might try this](http://vimeo.com/18591468).

Filter the network so that only nodes with > 30 connections appear, reduces the graph to ~1.5 % of the nodes, and 10% of all the connections

Leaves us with 4 communities, per modularity detection:
