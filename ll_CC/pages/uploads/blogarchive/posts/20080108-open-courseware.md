# Open Courseware

Just came across the [Open Courseware](http://ocwfinder.com/) site, a repository of links relating to a plethora of online course materials - for instance, it led me to a course from MIT on '[Computer Games and Simulations for Investigation and Education](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Urban-Studies-and-Planning/11-127Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm )'. Very nice! Under 'civilization -> ancient' are filed the following: 

[Foundations of Western Culture II: Modernism 21L.002-3, Spring 2004 (MIT)](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Literature/21L-002-3Spring-2004/CourseHome/index.htm) [Show Details](http://ocwfinder.com/#)

A broad survey of texts, literary, philosophical, and sociological, studied to trace the growth of secular humanism, the loss of a supernatural perspective upon human events, and changing conceptions of individual, social, and communal purpose. Stresses appreciation and analysis of texts that came to represent the common cultural possession of our time. The leading theme of this course is the question of the difference between the ancient and the modern world. Students who have taken Foundations of Western Culture I will obviously have an advantage in dealing with this question. Classroom discussion approaches this question mainly through consideration of action and characters, voice and form.

Analyzes a range of archaeological and literary evidence relevant to the use of space in Greek and Roman cities (e.g. Athens, Paestum, Rome, Pompeii) and a range of theoretical frameworks for the study of ancient urbanism.

Archaeology reconstructs ancient human activities and their environmental contexts. Drawing on case studies in contrasting environmental settings from the Near East and Mesoamerica, considers these activities and the forces that shaped them. In laboratory sessions students encounter various classes of archaeological data and analyze archaeological artifacts made from materials such as stone, bone, ceramics, glass, and metal. These analyses help reconstruct the past.
