# Civilization Revolution

![](http://www.firaxis.com/images/civrev/screenshots/rev_01.jpg)It seems that the Civilization franchise is [coming to the console market](http://www.firaxis.com/games/game_detail.php?gameid=17). This can only be a good thing, since I believe that Civilization is one of the greatest gifts the games industry ever gave us historian-folk. _Civilization: Revolution_ is not a straightforward port though of the PC version to the console. There are numerous differences, one of which is that it would seem that new content, scenarios etc will only be available for people with the Xbox Live service. On the plus side, presumably the interesting errors and glitches that exist in the player-created content won't be there (in my mod, if you look carefully, the Roman Senate looks an awful lot like the modern United Nations building... :) ). Anyway, an in-depth review is available [here.](http://apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?postid=5120755#post5120755) What I find also quite exciting, is that a port is planned for the[ Nintendo DS](http://www.firaxis.com/community/bts_afterworld.php) (the dual-screen; you've seen them, they look like little PDAs). The Nintendo DS allows multiplayer play when players are sitting together, over a tiny wi-fi link. This port will allow head-to-head competition over that link. From an educational point of view, this is the most valuable part of any commercial game used educationally: the ability for players/students to discuss and think about the playing - the metagame. Hopefully, new content will become available periodically for the DS version too. Official site: <http://civilizationrevolution.com/>
