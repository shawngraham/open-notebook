# 2006 ‘Networks, Agent-Based Modeling, and the Antonine Itineraries’. In The Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 19.1: 45-64.

It occurred to me that some of you might like to read this. [04_Graham](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/04_graham.pdf) I've got some other papers kicking around that I would like to expose to a wider readership; I'll post those too, once I find them on this machine again... my how cluttered things can get! I've been thinking of doing this for some time, but the kick in the pants I needed was courtesy of <http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2009/06/please-post-your-papers-on-internet.html> Abstract: This paper presents a way of looking at Roman space from a Roman perspective, and suggests ways in which this point of view might open up new approaches in Roman archaeology. It turns on one conception of Roman space in particular, preserved for us in the Antonine Itineraries. Working from a position that considers the context of the itineraries as movement-through-space, this paper presents an investigation using social network analysis and agent-based simulation to re-animate the itineraries. The itineraries for Iberia, Gaul, Italy, and Britain are considered. The results of the social network analysis suggest structural differences in the way that the itineraries presented space to the reader/traveler. The results of the simulation of information diffusion through these regions following the routes in the itineraries suggest ways that this conception of space affected the cultural and material development of these regions. Suggestions for extending the basic model for more complicated archaeolgoical analyses are presented.
