# Canada as viewed from Flickr

![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/canada-from-flickr.png) I'm playing with NodeXL, looking at the ways 'Canada' (and Canadian history) are tagged on Flickr photos. Above is a pretty first pass. Here's the [zoomable pdf ](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/canada-as-seen-from-flickr.pdf)for your enjoyment.

**[Jess](#11110 "2013-11-21 19:54:07"):** A very pretty first pass indeed. What tool was used to generate this, if I may ask?
