> [The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/) is an umbrella organization set up initially to coordinate more closely the activities of the Association for Computers in the Humanities (founded in 1978) and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (founded in 1973). The effort to establish ADHO began in Tuebingen, at the ALLC/ACH conference in 2002: a Steering Committee was appointed at the ALLC/ACH meeting in 2004, in Gothenburg, Sweden, and the executive committees of the ACH and ALLC approved the governance and conference protocols at the 2005 meeting in Victoria. In 2007, the ADHO Steering Committee voted to enfranchise The Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs (SDH-SEMI; founded in 1986 as the Consortium for Computers in the Humanities / Consortium pour ordinateurs en sciences humaines).
