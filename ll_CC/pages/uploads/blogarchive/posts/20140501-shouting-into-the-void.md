# Shouting into the Void?

Carleton has an annual 'academic retreat', which is happening this weekend. I'm not sure what, precisely, occurs there, but I've been asked to talk about things digital/history/archaeological. In the wake of the recent SAA [#blogarch ](https://twitter.com/search?q=blogarch&src=typd&f=realtime)session, and in advance of the upcoming special issue in Internet Archaeology on blogging archaeology, I thought I'd talk about one aspect of what I found when I set out to map the shape of 'roman archaeology' on the web.Â  It's an update to what I did in 2011, for the #blogarch session at that year's SAAs (you can read what I thought then [here](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2011/04/02/signal-versus-noise-why-academic-blogging-matters-a-structural-argument-saa-2011/).) I give you, 'Shouting into the Void? Social Media and the Construction of Cultural Heritage Knowledge Online' [slideshare id=34172273&sc=no]
