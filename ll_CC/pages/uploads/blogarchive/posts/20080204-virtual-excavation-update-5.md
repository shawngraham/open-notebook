# Virtual Excavation Update 5

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/GardenED.jpg)Turns out that ['digging' virtually with the land tools](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2008/01/22/sl_archaeology-or-the-virtual-excavation-update-4/) in Second Life is emphatically **not** a good idea. Things get out of control waaaay too easily. I suddenly had an [abyss ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyss_%28religion%29)and a [Matterhorn ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matterhorn)side-by-side in the middle of our plot of land, the bits and pieces of the demolished cabin flying violently about the place... yikes. Throw in a bit of lag and some rendering issues, and I had my own personal [Bosch](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/GardenED.jpg) going on. I tried show-hide scripts, which worked well enough, _except_ I could not then excavate what was underneath, though I could see it. That was because of course the original prim was still in position. D'oh. What I'm trying to do instead - and it seems to be working well - is to put a 'fly-away' script into each prim (representing a single context). When the student touches the context, it repositions itself 10m up in the air, revealing the next context underneath. I place internet-linked objects within the contexts as desired. When the context is 'excavated' - touched - the object goes into the student's inventory. The student needs to rename the objects appropriately - cataloging them - so as not to lose them in the inventory. They can then rez the objects to examine them, which opens up a browser window to the [Open Context ](http://opencontext.org/)archive. Next thing to think about is the interface with [Nabonidus](http://nabonidus.org/), whether to try to bring it in-world or let the students loose in their own browsers. Note also my prototype contexts are just wee boxes as of yet. They'll get better, promise. I suppose I could combine the show/hide with the fly-away, but then I'd have a devil of a time finding them again to reset for the next student. Picture below shows the current state of affairs. For reasons I cannot fathom, the regular Second Life client is not loading info from the website, but the [OnRez viewer](http://viewer.onrez.com/) works great. Go figure. ![bringing-in-info_002.jpg](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/bringing-in-info_002.jpg)
