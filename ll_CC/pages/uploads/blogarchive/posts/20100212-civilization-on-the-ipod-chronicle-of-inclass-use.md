# Civilization on the iPod - chronicle of inclass use

Just came across what seems to be an experiment in a classroom using Civ Revolution on the iPod for history teaching... will be interesting to see what happens. <http://ipodgamesforlearning.pbworks.com/Civilization-Revolution> ![](http://ipodgamesforlearning.pbworks.com/f/1265989617/civreviphone580.jpg) If I've divined the twitter feeds that led me to this, it would seem to be a project of [Lucas Gillespie](http://twitter.com/PCSTech) on whose [website ](http://edurealms.com/)there appears to be an interesting [World of Warcraft experimen](http://wowinschool.pbworks.com/)t going on... 

> The primary focus of this project is to develop a curriculum for an after school program or "club" for at-risk students at the middle and/or high school level.Â  This program would use the game, World of Warcraft, as a focal point for exploring Writing/Literacy, Mathematics, Digital Citizenship, Online Safety, and would have numerous projects/lessons intended to develop 21st-Century skills.

Bravo, and well done! One that I will follow with interest...
