# History Canada Game: Mod for Civ III

"The [History Canada Game](http://www.historicanada.com/) is a game based on Canadian history that lets anyone play the past. Based on the award-winning, best-seller Sid Meier's Civilization III, The History Canada Game is the "What If" game of Canada... and you're the author. Will you replay our history or rewrite it? The year is 1534... [Play the New World](http://www.historicanada.com/page.php?sid=42) ![get_game](http://www.historicanada.com/images/horse.jpg)

To Iroquois chief Donnacona, whose 500 followers live just down the St. Lawrence, Cartier’s intentions couldn’t be clearer. But these settlers bring with them powerful weapons, advanced technologies, and promises of great partnership to come. All they want is to take Donnacona’s two sons back to France with him. What would you do? Welcome the French as your newest allies? Or defend your homeland with extreme prejudice, and probably your life? What's next? You decide. The History Canada Game lets you relive, replay and even rewrite Canada’s history. Play as the English to expand your empire. Play as the Huron to defend your homeland. Wage wars, make peace and explore new lands...the future of Canadian history is in your hand."
