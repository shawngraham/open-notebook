# Slideshare and Slidecasting (and the Travellersim slideshow)

So [slideshare.net](http://www.slideshare.net/) has a new feature allowing the user to coordinate a podcast with a slideshow, and present it all in one neat package. Very nice. The only downside, that I can see, is that every slideshow is public. It is possible to embed a slideshare presentation into the [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org) environment, but I don't want people not in my class to view my show back at the original slideshare website. Here's a sample of what a slideshare presentation looks like (my own presentation from the 2006 Congress of the Humanities at York University): [slideshare id=89905&doc=travellersim3429&w=425]
