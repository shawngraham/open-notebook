# SAA 2015: Macroscopic approaches to archaeological histories: Insights into archaeological practice from digital methods

Ben Marwick and I are organizing a session for the SAA2015 (the 80th edition, this year in San Francisco) on "Macroscopic approaches to archaeological histories: Insights into archaeological practice from digital methods". It's a pretty big tent. Below is the session ID and the abstract. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, why don't you get in touch? Session ID 743. The history of archaeology, like most disciplines, is often presented as a sequence of influential individuals and a discussion of their greatest hits in the literature.  Two problems with this traditional approach are that it sidelines the majority of participants in the archaeological literature who are excluded from these discussions, and it does not capture the conversations outside of the canonical literature.  Recently developed computationally intensive methods as well as creative uses of existing digital tools can address these problems by efficiently enabling quantitative analyses of large volumes of text and other digital objects, and enabling large scale analysis of non-traditional research products such as blogs, images and other media. This session explores these methods, their potentials, and their perils, as we employ so-called 'big data' approaches to our own discipline. \---- Like I said, if that sounds like something you'd be curious to know more about, ping me.
