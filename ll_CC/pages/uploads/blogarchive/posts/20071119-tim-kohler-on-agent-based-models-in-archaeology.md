# Tim Kohler on Agent Based Models in Archaeology

The powerpoint from Tim Kohler's presentation of ABM for archaeology may be found [here](http://www.gemas.fr/dphan/laLonde/docs/timKohlerLaLonde.pdf) . It was part of this conference: 

## Agent Based Models for Spatial Systems in Social Sciences & Economic Science with Heterogeneous Interacting Agents

## (ABM–S4–ESHIA)

### Agelonde, La Londe les Maures (var, France), September 17-22, 2007 (6 days).

From the look of the other [presentations](http://www.gemas.fr/dphan/laLonde/) (scroll down, links to ppts), it looks like it was a fascinating time. I'm sorry I missed it!
