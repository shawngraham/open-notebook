# "History for Music Lovers"

Came across the '[historyteacher's channel' on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/historyteachers#g/u) today. Absolutely brilliant videos & lyrics mashing up modern pop with historical topics. What better to start a Friday 8.30 lecture with than Radiohead rejigged for Minoan Crete? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz3d5x-MUT4 or a bit of Constantine + Dexy's Midnight Runners... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYhMQNPa8mM
