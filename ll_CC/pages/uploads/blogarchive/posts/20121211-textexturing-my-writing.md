# Textexturing My Writing

[caption id="attachment_1643" align="alignleft" width="162"]![Topic model, via Textexture, of my 'evaluating digital humanities' post](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/textexture1.png?w=150) Topic model, via Textexture, of my 'evaluating digital humanities' post[/caption] I fed two recent posts, ['Evaluating Digital Humanities](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/12/02/evaluating-digital-work-in-the-humanities/)', and ['Deformative Digital Archaeology'](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/11/22/deformative-digital-archaeology/), into [Textexture.com](http://textexture.com). Textexture topic models your input texts, and then visualizes them via [Gephi](http://gephi.org) so that you can explore the interlinkages of topics/discourses whilst revisualizing them at the same time. You can play and explore the results for yourself at: [http://textexture.com/index.php?text_id=6941 ](http://textexture.com/index.php?text_id=6941) Evaluating Digital Humanities <http://textexture.com/index.php?text_id=6943> Deformative Digital Archaeology. You'll want to hit 'start layout' to make these look a bit more presentable. Note that you can also download the gexf file itself, to open in Gephi, to try other layouts/metrics. I find it reassuring, somehow, that natural divisions in my texts (for instance, in the second image, the code explications are clearly distinct, in red, from the broader discussion on the nature of digital archaeology, in blue). Unfortunately, Textexture only deals with relatively smallish chunks of text for now.
