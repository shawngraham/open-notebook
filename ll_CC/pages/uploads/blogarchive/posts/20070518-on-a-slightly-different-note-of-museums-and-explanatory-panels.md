# On a slightly different note - of museums and explanatory panels

We took some kids yesterday to the Museum of Civilization in Hull Quebec (now Gatineau, due to a renaming orgy by the Province) to see the 'Treasures of China' exhibit. It's quite amazing, and I confess an utter ignorance on Chinese history and material culture. Interestingly enough, the curators of the exhibit provided panels with timelines of Chinese history, against which was a timeline of major points in Western history, for comparison purposes. So far, so good. And then I noticed - the curators have the destruction of Pompeii by Mt. Vesuvius as taking place in 79 **BC**, and Julius Caesar as Emperor of Rome in 45 BC. So two quite basic flubs - but if that material isn't correct, how can I trust the information I'm being told about ancient China? (Pompeii: destroyed in **AD** 79 - 158 years later - and Julius Caesar was never Emperor. Octavian, Caesar's heir, became the first Emperor, when the Senate called him Augustus on January 16, 27 BC and the 'First Settlement' was reached.)
