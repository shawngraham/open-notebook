# When on Google Earth?

Just came across a [fun little game the geologists are playing](http://pluffi.smugmug.com/gallery/4206594_PBb4L#413754901_MB7qW) (and [here](http://lostgeologist.blogspot.com/2008/11/woge-154.html)), called 'Where on Google Earth?' One person snaps a pic from Google Earth, and posts it, as follows:![Where on Google Earth?](http://pluffi.smugmug.com/photos/413754901_MB7qW-M.jpg) and calls it WoGE 155 (and tags the post similarly). The players have to identify the location and geology of the place in the photograph in a comment on the originating post, ie, 

> "[WoGE #154](http://lostgeologist.blogspot.com/2008/11/woge-154.html) focused on the GSSP type locality for the K/T boundary, located within the Haria formation of the northern Tunisian Atlas. I found it, so here we go again. Be the first to locate AND give relevant geological description of this spot [ie, the photograph above], and you'll have the privilege to post the next WoGE. This is a free run, hope not to easy for the pros."

The winning player then gets the right to post the next image. I think this is fun. So in a similar vein, I propose When on Google Earth #1: [caption id="attachment_517" align="alignleft" width="690" caption="When on Google Earth? #1"]![When on Google Earth? #1](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/whenonge1.jpg)[/caption] What are we looking at, and when was the major period of occupation? Leave responses in the comments; first right answer gets to host 'When on Google Earth #2'! (no new car, alas...)

**[Lars Anderson](#1827 "2009-02-02 12:25:19"):** oops I commented on the wrong post first! Persepolis in Iran, roughly 500 to 300 BCE?

**[declan](#1817 "2009-01-30 11:27:34"):** Haven't a clue. Great idea. Now my evenings going to be ruined (ho, ho, ho) looking for this.

**[Chuck Jones](#1818 "2009-01-30 13:17:09"):** Takht-i Jamshid / Persepolis terrace Northeast of Shiraz, Fars Province, Iran Achaemenid period

**[Shawn](#1819 "2009-01-30 13:28:17"):** Yessir! Your turn - don't forget to tag your post 'whenonge? #2'

**[Alun](#1822 "2009-01-31 12:59:35"):** I didn't have a clue as to when that one was. Mind you I'm totally stuck on the next one too, so at least I'm consistent. :)

**[Chuck Jones](#1823 "2009-02-01 11:51:33"):** The anonymous winner of round 2 failed to materialize by the deadline, so I offer [When On Google Earth?, No. 2.1](http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2009/01/over-at-electric-archaeology-shawn-has.html)
