# Virtual Worlds: and the most powerful graphics engine there is

![](http://www.keithpalmer.ca/images/BrainAd2.jpg) Virtual worlds are not all about stunning immersive 3d graphics. No, to riff on the old Infocom advertisement, it's your brain that matters most.  That's right folks, the text adventure. Long time readers of this blog will know that I have experimented with this kind of immersive virtual world building for archaeological and historical purposes. But, with one thing and another, that all got put on a back shelf. Today, I discover via Jeremiah McCall's [Historical Simulations / Serious Games in the Classroom site](http://historicalsimulations.net/serious%20games/index.htm) [Interactive Fiction (text adventure) games about Viking Sagas](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm) \- part of Christopher Fee's English 401 course at Gettysburg College. Yes, complete interactive fictions about various parts of the Viking world! (see the list below). I'm downloading these to my netbook to play on my next plane journey. Now, interactive fiction can be quite complex, with interactions and artificial intelligence as compelling as anything generated in 3d - see the work of [Emily Short](http://emshort.wordpress.com/). And while creating immersive 3d can be quite complex and costly in hardware/software, [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) allows its generation quite easily (AND as a bonus teaches a lot about effective world building!) 

> **Explore the Sites and Sagas of the Ancient and Medieval North Atlantic through one of Settings of _The Secret of Otter's Ransom_** **IF Adventure Game:**The earliest version of the _Otter's Ransom_ game was designed to be extremely simple, and to illustrate the pedagogical aims of the project as well as the ease of composing with _Inform 7_ software: In this iteration the game contains no graphics or links, utilizes very little in the way of software functions, tricks, or "bells and whistles," and contains a number of rooms in each of sixteen different game settings; as the project progresses, more rooms, objects and situations will be added by the students and instructor of English 401, as well as appropriate "bells and whistles" and relevant links to pertinent multimedia objects from the _Medieval North Atlantic_ project. Using simple, plain English commands such as "go east," "take spear-head," "look at sign" and "open door" to navigate, the player may move through each game setting; moreover, as a by-product of playing the game successfully, a player concurrently may learn a great deal about a number of specific historical sites, as well as about such overarching themes as the history of Viking raids on monasteries, the character of several of the main Norse gods, and the volatile mix of paganism and Christianity in Viking Britain. The earliest form of the game is open-ended in each of the sixteen settings, but eventually the complete "meta-game" of _The Secret of Otter's Ransom_ will end when the player gathers the necessary magical knowledge to break an ancient curse, which concurrently will require that player to piece together enough historical and cultural information to pass an exit quiz.  Play all-text versions of the site games from _The Secret of Otter's Ransom_ using the [Frotz game-playing software.](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/MedievalNorthAtlantic/WindowsFrotz2002/Frotz.exe) Play versions of the site games which include relevant images using the [Windows Glulxe game-playing software.](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/MedievalNorthAtlantic/WinGlulxeInstaller.exe) In order to view images the player must "take" them, as in "take inscription;" very large images may come up as "[MORE]" which indicates that text will scroll off the screen when the image is displayed. Simply hit the return key once or twice and the image will be displayed. We hope that you will enjoy engaging in adventure-style exploration of Viking sites and objects from the Ancient and Medieval North Atlantic! Start by saving one of the following modules onto your desktop; next click the above game-playing software. When you try to open the Frotz software (you may have to click "Run" twice) your computer will ask you to select which game you'd like to play; simply select the module on your desktop to begin your adventure; you may have to search for "All Files." Each game setting includes a short paragraph describing tips, traps, and techniques of playing: **[Andreas Ragnarok Cross](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Andreas)** **[Balladoole Ship Burial](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Balladoole)** **[Braaid Farmstead](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Braaid)** **[Broch of Gurness**](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Gurness) **[Brough of Birsay Settlement](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Birsay)** **Brussels Cross ** **[Chesters Roman Fort](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Chesters)** **[Cronk ny Merriu Fortlet**](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Cronk) **[Cunningsburgh Quarry ](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Quarry)** **[Helgafell Settlement](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Helgafell) ** **Hvamm Settlement ** **[Hadrian's Wall**](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Hadrian) **[Jarlshof Settlement](http://public.gettysburg.edu/%7Ecfee/courses/English4012001/topic3.htm#Jarlshof)**
