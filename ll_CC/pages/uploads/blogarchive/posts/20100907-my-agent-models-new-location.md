# My Agent Models - new location

In 2005, I was the first Post-doctoral Research Fellow in Roman Archaeology at the University of Manitoba. In that research, I was exploring the use of Agent Based Modeling methods for understanding various questions of Roman Archaeology. I've since moved to Carleton University. My models are now housed on some space I've got, and can be accessed below: [The Antonine Itineraries & Information Diffusion](http://www.graeworks.net/abm/itineraries.html) Published in the Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 19.1 [PatronWorld ](http://www.graeworks.net/abm/PatronWorld.html)Published in Digital Studies [Travellersim ](http://www.graeworks.net/abm/Travellersim.html)Published in the Proceedings of the 2006 Computer Applications in Archaeology conference [City Life](http://www.graeworks.net/abm/pompeii.html) \- a toy, still under development, for exploring flow in ancient cities You should be able to download the relevant nlogo files, too - but nb the U Manitoba email address no longer applies.
