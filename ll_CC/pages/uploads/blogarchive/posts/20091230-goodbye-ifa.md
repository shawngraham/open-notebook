# Goodbye, IFA

I've been a [Member of the Institute For Archaeologist](http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=1) (ne Institute of Field Archaeologists) since 2004. This year, I've let my membership expire. Two reasons, really. One, my academic life has been taking me further and further away from what the IFA is about (though I will continue to cheer it from the sidelines); I'm not working in consulting archaeology in the UK, soÂ  it seems time to let it go. Two, money is always tight, frankly. Membership dues in pounds sterling paid in C$ can buy other needful things. I've planned a longer meditation on professional bodies, archaeology, Canada, UK, and North America, but I think I'll let it marinate a bit longer.
