# About a Barn

I found another presentation on that same laptop, this time related to the agricultural vernacular... that is to say, about a barn. I was very pleased with that title... Again, the venue was [the Friends of Gatineau Park ](http://guidegatineau.ca/amis-friends/)annual research forum. [slideshare id=15370150&doc=aboutabarnbilingue-121127085615-phpapp02]

It's good to come across a blog every once in a while that isn't the same out of date rehashed material. Fantastic read! I've bookmarked your site and I'm including your RSS feeds to my Google account.

I once again find myself spending a lot of time both reading and posting comments. But so what, it was still worthwhile!
