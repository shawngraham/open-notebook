# Nabonidus & RWU Virtual Excavation

Just a pic to show how [Nabonidus ](http://nabonidus.org/)can be brought into the virtual excavation. In the picture, I've just touched and 'excavated' the topmost layer on the site, and have clicked on the Nabonidus link in the background. This opens Nabonidus in a browser. I then login, without leaving second life, and can enter the relevant information.
