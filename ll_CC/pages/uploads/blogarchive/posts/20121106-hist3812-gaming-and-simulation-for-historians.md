# HIST3812, Gaming and Simulation for Historians

Finally, with a bit of space to breathe, I am turning to getting my HIST3812 Gaming and Simulation for Historians course put together. In response to student queries about what this course will explore, I've put together a wee comic book (to capture the aesthetic of playfulness about history that games & simulations naturally contain). I'm not a particularly good maker of comic books, but it does the trick, more or less. See it on [Issuu here](http://issuu.com/dr.graham/docs/3812comic-book?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222) [gigya src="http://static.issuu.com/webembed/viewers/style1/v2/IssuuReader.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" menu="false" wmode="transparent" style="width:420px;height:272px" flashvars="mode=mini&backgroundColor=%23222222&documentId=121106170418-646a7dace21d445686090c1eb713a5a1" ]
