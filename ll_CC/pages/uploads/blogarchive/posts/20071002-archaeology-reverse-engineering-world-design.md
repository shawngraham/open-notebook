# Archaeology: Reverse Engineering World Design

Throughout my years as a student, I learned to dread the scorn and sarcasm that would inevitably follow the question, 'so what are you studying?' I'm by no means the first person - nor the last - to have to defend 'archaeology' to a wider public. I'm rather sick of having to defend it. Nowadays I just point out that my freelancing lets me set my own hours, live where I want to, and generally have a very nice life. Hell, my student debt only equals the price of a nice car (granted, a _very_ nice car). Anyway, the point of this post is to direct your attention to an interview on the [Game Career Guide](http://www.gamecareerguide.com/index.php) with game writers Sande Chen and Anne Tool, where they explain '[how I became a game writer](http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/424/features/424/features/424/features/424/how_i_became_a_game_writer_an_.php)'. Pay attention to Tool's background, especially... <snippet>

> archaeology, as a subdiscipline of anthropology, is arguably the most liberal of the liberal arts majors. Through the department I was able to study science, history, art, mythology -- just about anything I wanted, and it all counted toward my degree. To my great delight, it also gave me the perfect excuse to study abroad. I attended the American University in Cairo for six months, where I studied under Egyptologist Kent Weeks with an eclectic group of American expatriates. My senior thesis focused on the economic aspects of ancient Egyptian settlements. In it, I analyzed the form and function of the few remaining settlement sites from ancient times to draw conclusions about the economy and culture of ancient Egypt. Essentially, I reverse engineered Egyptian world design. 

I love that idea that making games is about designing worlds, and its corollary, that archaeology is reverse-engineering of past world designs. I taught a course once at [Birkbeck College](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/), University of London that essentially argued a similar point - the layout of towns and settlements is the cosmology of that culture writ in building materials. But that is a digression for another day. In any event, just one more example of how archaeology opens doors you never imagined...
