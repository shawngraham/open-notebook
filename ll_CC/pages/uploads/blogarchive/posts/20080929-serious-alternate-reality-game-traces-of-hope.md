# Serious Alternate Reality Game: Traces of Hope

It is interesting the number of ARGs emerging that have serious purposes behind them. One such is 'Traces of Hope' - 

> “Traces of Hope” is being launched as the first ever charity online ARG and is being built by the British Red Cross to coincide with its Civilians and Conflict month. The game features Joseph a sixteen-years-old caught up in the Ugandan civil war, separated from his family, hungry and alone in a camp overflowing with thousands forced to flee, Joseph is desperately seeking his mother. But he needs your help…
> 
> Registration will open on Sunday 28th but until then there’s a teaser page at [www.tracesofhope.com](http://www.tracesofhope.com/) and a teaser video at <http://www.vimeo.com/1811645>
