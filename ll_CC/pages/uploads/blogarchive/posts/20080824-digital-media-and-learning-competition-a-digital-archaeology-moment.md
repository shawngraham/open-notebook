# Digital Media and Learning Competition: a digital archaeology moment?

The following appeared on my 'discussion' page this morning: 

> We would like you and your readers to consider applying for and to help get out the word about our second (2008 HASTAC/MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning Competition. Itâ€™s a $2 Million Competition. Focus: Participatory Learning Application Deadline: October 15, 2008 Full information at: [http://www.dmlcompetition.net](http://www.dmlcompetition.net/) Awards will be made in two categories: Innovation in Participatory Learning Awards support large-scale digital learning projects $30,000-$250,000 Young Innovator Awards are targeted at 18-25 year olds $5,000-$30,000

I would be interested in putting in an application for myself, but the thought occurs: there are a lot of digital media/archaeology types out there, with great ideas and motivation, but not so much funding perhaps. Why don't we put together a collaborative proposal?
