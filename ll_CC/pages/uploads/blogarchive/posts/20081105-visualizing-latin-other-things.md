# Visualizing Latin & Other Things

In an earlier post, I tried visualizing the structure of Latin inscriptions from a particular time and place by turning them (some 30 or so, as I recall) into a kind of directed network graph, the theory being that a network analysis might reveal something of the underlying structure of inscriptions in general. It was the mental equivalent of doodling, but I wondered if the approach might have some sort of predictive power, eg for inscriptions that were incomplete. Just idle curiosity - the same idleness which drove me to run the following through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net) (can't get enough of that toy!) - from the Epigraphische Datenbank Heidelberg: province: Britannia modern country: United Kingdom find spot (ancient name): Aquae Sulis find spot (modern name): Bath (Avon) find spot (street, etc.): RÃ¶misches Bad literature: AE 1983, 0633. M.W.C. Hassall - R.S.O. Tomlin, Britannia 14, 1983, 336, Nr. 3; fig. 33 u. 34 (Zeichnungen). - AE. A-Text: Primurudem // Basilia donat in templum Martis ani/lum(!) argenteum si servus si liber / (ta)mdiu siluerit vel aliquid de hoc / noverit ut sanguin(e) et liminibus(!) ob(!) // omnibus(!) membris(!) configatur vel et/iam intestinis excomesis (om)nibus habe(at) / is qui anilum(!) involavit(!) vel qui medius / fuerit ...which gives the following wordle cloud: ![Britannia 14, 1983, 336, Nr. 34](http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/291250/Britannia_14%2C_1983%2C_336%2C_Nr._3%3B_fig.33) ...which may or may not be a useful exercise. Guess I'd best ask a proper epigrapher. But in the spirit of discovering tools for visualization of data in new and hopefully illuminating ways, the following page, [a periodic table of visualization methods](http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html#), might introduce you to some new approaches.
