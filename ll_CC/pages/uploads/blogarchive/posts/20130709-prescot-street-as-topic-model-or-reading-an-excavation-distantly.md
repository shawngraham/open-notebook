# Prescot Street as Topic Model, or, reading an excavation distantly

I tried a new tact in my quest to data mine archaeological records. Stuart Eve sent me the csv from the Prescot Street excavations, where each record was a unique context. I fed this into the vanilla java gui for MALLET (so no tuning, just the basic settings, looking for 25 topics) to see what - if anything - might result. The output seems very promising. I deliberately did not look up any information on the excavation until after I'd run this analysis. Can reading site records algorithmically tell us anything useful, that we did not otherwise know? As I often do, I posted my initial reaction to twitter: https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo/status/353326790787346434 How to visualize this? I'm growing cold towards network visualizations of this kind of data, but in this case a two-mode representation might be appropriate, since the topic modeling algorithm is functioning as a kind of unsupervised clustering routine, pulling words out of the records that seem to go together. Here's a two-mode network of the results, contexts tied to their constituent topics: [caption id="attachment_1837" align="alignleft" width="450"]![Prescot Street as Topic Model.](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/prescott-street.png) Prescot Street as Topic Model.[/caption] It seems promising. In that image, I took the excavators' names out. But upon reflection, I shouldn't do that: https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo/statuses/353327747889770496 I asked Gephi to look for modules (communities; groups; based on similarity of ties) within this two mode network. Below are a series of images that focus on the individual modules. Two items jump out immediately - one, particular excavators are associated with particular word choice, patterning of word usages; two, particular kinds of materials clump together quite nicely. Do particular excavators 'see' particular kinds of info that others don't? Do they 'specialize' in certain kinds of info? As a newbie on the Forum Novum project for BSR many years ago, I was never allowed on any of the 'interesting' stuff, being consigned to digging through layers of fill to find the depth of the natural soil level. There's only so many ways to describe dirt. This kind of thing happens often. You want your most experienced excavators to handle the most delicate/intricate/complicated situations, but... I wonder. Topic modeling this material, whilst including the names of the excavators attached to each context, seems to shed interesting light on the ways we see things archaeologically. In my other experiments with the PAS database, because of extraneous commas creeping in and shifting the fields, I often ended up with an inconsistent inclusion of the finds officers' names, so I tended to just exclude them completely. That might be an error. I think we need to know whose voice is most tied to the 'topics'/'discourses' that make up our record (after all, once it's excavated, this is all we have left, right?) This experiment here suggests that perhaps one of the more valuable outcomes of topic modeling archaeological material is the re-introduction of subjectivity into our records, the idea that many voices (modern and ancient) make up the 'record' - and we should listen to them. In due course I'll put the html up somewhere so that the interested reader can jump through the contexts along the topic - context - topic pathways suggested by the topic modeling. We use Harris matrices (a kind of network) to understand the three dimensional relationships amongst contexts (which imply their chronological ordering); what kinds of insights can deforming our reading of an excavation along the network paths suggested by the topic modeling produce? Below are the visualizations of the modules.

## Comments

**[colleenmorgan](#10508 "2013-07-11 05:25:11"):** Is there any way you could spatialize these? Work them into the GIS data?

**[Shawn](#10510 "2013-07-11 11:01:53"):** Yes. I think you could probably tie the individual contexts over space to the various topic models, or perhaps work the various word weights within topics to the contexts, displaying them as a Harris matrix... I'm bouncing a couple of ideas around!
