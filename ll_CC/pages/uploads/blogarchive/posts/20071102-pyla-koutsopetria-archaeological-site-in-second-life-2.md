# Pyla-Koutsopetria: archaeological site in Second Life (2)

Scott Moore's blog about PKAP and its existence in Second Life can be found [here;](http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/2420404/22741568) here's the [SLURL](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Crimson%20Island/55.5898/146.573). 

> "Ok, the first part of the PKAP presence in SL is far enough along to talk about it. The problem has been that I am learning as I go along and ...... let's just say the path has had its pitfalls. So, a little background first. Last spring, I wrote a small grant with Dr. Bev Chiarulli from IUP's Anthro department to fund the development of an archaeology island in Second Life (SL) and we were pleasantly surprised to have it funded by a grant from IUP. We started working on the project and were very, very fortunate to make the acquaintance of Dr. Allen Partridge of IUP's Applied Media and Simulation Games Center who has brought his considerable expertise to the project. Dr. Partridge and his staff have been helping us design an island that will allow visitors to experience three different archaeological sites: 1) our PKAP site, focusing on the hill of Vigla; 2) Dr. Chiarulli's work in Belize with Mayan culture; and 3) an underwater site with a shipwreck. We are still working on this island and hope to make it available to the public this spring."
