# Archaeology Magazine & Blogging Archaeology

Just a note to say that William Caraher's excellent discussion about '[blogging archaeology](http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/)', which first saw life -natch- as a [series of blog posts,](http://mediterraneanworld.typepad.com/the_archaeology_of_the_me/2007/12/blogging-arch-2.html) is now up on [Archaeology Magazine](http://www.archaeology.org/)'s website. William writes on his [own blog](http://mediterraneanworld.typepad.com/the_archaeology_of_the_me/2008/01/varia-and-quick.html): 

> "Thanks to everyone who helped with the revisions and Mark Rose at the [Archaeological Institute of America](http://www.archaeological.org/) who provided some nice editorial touches and his web-design who helped its slick appearance.  I hope to be able to provide an update to the article in 9 or 12 months time and continue to track some of the developments in the blogosphere. [...] It will be interesting to track the way in which certain genres coalesce in the blogosphere over the next several years.  On the one hand, there are clearly certain relatively well-defined and recognizable types of blogs: research blogs, teaching blogs, news blogs, graduate student blogs et c.).  On the other hand, there does seem to be a willingness to experiment with hybrid blogs that bring together teaching and research and present themselves in a conversational style."

It's a fantastic piece, and an excellent place to start when you're interested to know what's going on in the archaeological blogosphere.
