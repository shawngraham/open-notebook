# Prezi for Archaeology

I'm entranced by the possibilities of [Prezi ](http://prezi.com)for displaying archaeological knowledge. Prezi changes the metaphor of presentation from 'slides' to 'zooming', which (aside from a bit of nausea-inducing swirls) looks very promising. For instance, I can imaging starting with an aerial photograph of the site - then zooming down to the ground, then zooming through to the first few days of excavation, and so on.... or alternatively, a prezi of a Harris matrix, and being able to zoom into each context to display/link to each artefact etc...  (you can also pan and drag too) exciting stuff! I've got some materials on my other machine that I'll be playing with. I searched through the 'showcase' and found two archaeological presentations.  Of the two, I think the second one by Natalie Farrell is the more effective - but then again, I haven't tried creating one myself, so no criticisms from me until I've created one. (I can't embed them into wordpress.com, so follow the links) <http://prezi.com/oe5bw25e3utx/archaeology-and-the-speculative-turn/> <http://prezi.com/5nugigpseiup/theory-and-methodology-in-contract-archaeology/>
