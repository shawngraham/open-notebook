# PMOG Mission: "Awww Sir, how can I find out anything about that?"

First attempt at a PMOG mission. Most missions I've gone through so far are more like tours of thematically linked websites, althoughÂ  there are some notable exceptions that require the player to deduce the next site from clues placed in the first. I gave it a try, which you may find here: [Awww Sir, how can I find out anything about that?](http://pmog.com/missions/awww_sir_how_can_i_find_out_anything_about_that_) The idea here is a mix of straightforward take-you-by-the-hand tour of places to go to answer one student's question about research, as well as one little (simple) puzzle to find the last step. 'Puzzle' is too grand a word, but I was trying to work out the mechanics of setting up a mission. The next one will be more involved...
