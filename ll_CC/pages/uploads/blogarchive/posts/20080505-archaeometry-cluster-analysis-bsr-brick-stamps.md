# Archaeometry Cluster Analysis, BSR Brick Stamps

A few posts ago I put up the raw data from [my xrd analysis ](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/xrd-results-of-british-school-at-rome-stamped-bricks/)of the South Etruria Survey Brick Stamp collection conserved at the [British School at Rome](http://www.bsr.ac.uk), suggesting that it might be, amongst other things, useful in teaching archaeological statistics... happily, it is being used in just that fashion at Â [ the Quantitative Archaeology Wiki.](http://wiki.iosa.it/dokuwiki/archaeometry:cluster_analysis) The wiki seems to be maintained by scholars in Italy, but I'm not sure. One of their projects is to update the exercises in Fletcher and Lock's "Digging Numbers". I still have that on my bookshelf - it was the required text in Archae 341 at [WLU](http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=296), back in '96... (I note also that one of the banner images from the Laurier archae website is of an old classmate in his long-haired days, who is now a lecturer at the University of Western Ontario...nice one, Marty!)

The contents are actually VERY draft and I even doubt the cluster example makes sense at this point. I still haven't had a chance to read your BAR volume but I'll do that as soon as I can to see which kind of analyses you performed on that data. And, by the way, if you feel like correcting some mistakes or adding some hints on the wiki, please do it. The wiki is open.
