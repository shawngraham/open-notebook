> [Announcing] a new scholarship opportunity for students enrolled in archaeological field schools that have been certified by the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA). This year, RPA's sponsoring organizations American Anthropological Association, Archaeological Institute of America, Society for American Archaeology, and Society for Historical Archaeology will each make an award to a field school director who will present the award to one of his/her deserving students.
> 
> If you plan to offer a field school this year and would like an opportunity for one of your students to receive a scholarship, please apply for the RPA field school scholarship. The application process is quick and costs nothing.
