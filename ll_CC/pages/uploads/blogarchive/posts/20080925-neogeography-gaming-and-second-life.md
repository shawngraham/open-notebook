# Neogeography, Gaming and Second Life

Archaeologists, take note of [work coming out of CASA ](http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/working_papers/paper142.pdf)at UCL in the UK: 

> [two issues are addressed:] firstly that spatial data is still inherently difficult to share and visualise for the non-GIS trained academic or professional and secondly that a geographic data social network has the potential to dramatically open up data sources for both the public and professional geographer. With our applications of [GMap Creator](http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/software/gmapcreator.asp), and [MapTube](http://www.maptube.org/) to name but two, we detail ways to intelligently visualise and share spatial data. This paper concludes with detailing usage and outreach as well as an insight into how such tools are already providing a significant impact to the outreach of geographic information.‚Äù

Now, this is work that has obvious archaeological implications. On another note, the same group is implementing ABM in Second Life. I particularly like the screen-grab of an escaped agent wandering off into the Metaverse. There's something profoundly disturbing about that... <http://gisagents.blogspot.com/2008/08/news-new-working-paper-and-abm-in.html> <http://gisagents.blogspot.com/2008/09/update-agents-in-second-life.html> ![](/DOCUME~1/Shawn/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-3.jpg)
