# Networks, Complexity, and Agent Based Modelling

A presentation I gave to the[ Hispanic Baroque Project](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca) folks at UWO has been made available on their website. The links to each part are below. [(Part 1](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham1/Graham1.html)) ([Part 2](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham2/Graham2.html)) ([Part 3](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham3/Graham3.html)) ([Part 4](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham4/Graham4.html)) ([Part 5](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham5/Graham5.html)) ([Part 6](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham6/Graham6.html)) ([Part 7](http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/videos/Graham7/Graham7.html)) (there are few things more excruciating than watching yourself present.
