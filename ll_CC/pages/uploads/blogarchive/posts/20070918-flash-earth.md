# Flash Earth

I clearly have too much time on my hands today. Anyway, I found 'Flash Earth', a site that allows you to select and display different sources of aerial/satellite imagery for whatever location you happen to be looking at. This [link ](http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=42.331024&lon=12.603815&z=16.9&r=0&src=ggl)displays the location of Forum Novum. By cycling through the different sources, I found some images that were much higher resolution than the Google ones, other images displayed crop marks, and in one you can clearly see the trenches from our excavations in '99 and 2000. Flash Earth would seem to be a handy tool.
