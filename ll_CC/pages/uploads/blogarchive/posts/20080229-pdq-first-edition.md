# PD(Q) - first edition

I went over to the [PD(Q) edublogs page](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/2008/02/13/vol-11-digital-publishing-end-feb-2008/) this morning to see how submissions were coming along for the first edition. The range is quite interesting! Offerings include- 

  * my own discussion of putting together the Electric Archaeology Blook 'Best of the Blog'
  * a [review by Alun](http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/2008/02/16/scholarly-journals-between-the-past-and-the-future-by-martin-rundkvist/) of Rundkvist, M. 2007. _Scholarly Journals between the Past and the Future: The Fornv√§nnen Centenary Round-Table Seminar, Stockholmm 21 April 2006_. Konferenser 65. Kungl. Vitterhets Historie och Antikvitets Akademien.
  * three related postings by Kylie Sturgess on [writing 'skeptical' books for children](http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/01/17/skeptical-books-for-children-part-one/)
  * and a piece by Tim Jones on the '[Looting of the Iraqi Museum - video review](http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1406608144/bclid1406589060/bctid1407489931)'
