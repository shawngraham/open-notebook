# Historiographical issues & computer games

I punched that title into Google to see what would come up. Thought I'd share the more interesting results (in no particular order):

> **ABSTRACT** Cognitive research has revealed learning techniques more effective than those utilized by the traditional art history lecture survey course. Informed by these insights, the author and fellow graduate researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago designed a “serious” computer game demo, Art Thief, as a potential model for a learning tool that incorporates content from art history. The game design implements constructed learning, simulated cooperation and problem solving in a first-person, immersive, goal-oriented mystery set within a virtual art museum.

**[Steve](#2976 "2010-04-15 11:57:46"):** Hello, I thought that readers of this post might find this interesting. I was recently at the Forum in Rome using an iPhone app called "Voyager X-Drive: Roman Forum". For a few Euro, you can get this app, which uses the phone's GPS and Magnetometer, allowing you to walk around and move the phone around you (around the ruins of the forum) and see a reconstruction of the buildings from the Constantine period. It's like x-ray vision or something, and i can't tell you how impressed i was. I showed it to a few other people at the Forum, and they truly flipped - so i thought i'd pass the word along! If you are going to Rome, this is the BEST possible tour you could take, and it's way cooler and cheaper than those lame 'audio tour' handsets. You can find their site here, along with some YouTube video demos: http://voyager.illusionetwork.com/ Cheers...!
