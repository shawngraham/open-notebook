# Electric Archaeology: 3 years in the Blogoverse

I just realized. I've been intermittently blogging now for three years, as of this December past. In that time, I think I've remained more or less true to the 'mission' of Electric Archaeology - to try out new techs, recount experiments, disseminate my research, in new media for archaeology and history. There have been times when I could post thoughtful, in-depth pieces; and times when I've merely passed on the interesting things that have turned up in my inbox. As of this morning according to Wordpress, Electric Archaeology has had over 85,000 views, spread across 394 posts. There have been 329 comments made. I have 62 categories - clearly I need some rationalization there. I sometimes toy with the idea of moving Electric Archaeology to my own space, so I can put some better analytics on it, but for whatever reason, that just doesn't happen... :) The all time most viewed posts on Electric Archaeology (the most recent posts of course are at the bottom, having had less chance to be viewed):
