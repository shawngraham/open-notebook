# Deformative Digital Archaeology

[caption id="attachment_1617" align="alignleft" width="150"]![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/1st-3-centuries-brick.png?w=150) An archaeological visualization.[/caption] Is digital archaeology part of the digital humanities? This isn't to get into another who's in/who's out conversation. Rather, I was thinking about the ways archaeologists use computing in archaeology, and to what ends. The[ Computer Applications in Archaeology Conference](http://caaconference.org/about/) has been publishing proceedings since 1973, or longer than I've been on this earth. Archaeologists have been running simulations, doing spatial analysis, clustering, imaging, geophysicing, 3d modeling, neutron activation analyzing,[ x-tent modeling , etc, ](http://wiki.iosa.it/dokuwiki-head/models/start)for what seems like ages. Surely, then, digital archaeologists are digital humanists too? [Trevor Owens has a recent post](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/11/discovery-and-justification-are-different-notes-on-sciencing-the-humanities/) that sheds useful light on the matter. Trevor draws attention to the purpose behind one's use of computational power - generative discovery versus justification of an hypothesis. For Trevor, if we are using computational power to [deform ](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/02/deforming-reality-with-word-lens/)our texts, we are trying to see things in a new light, new juxtapositions, to spark new insight. Ramsay talks about this too in Reading Machines (2011: 33), discussing the work of Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels. "Reading a poem backward is like viewing the face of a watch sideways - a way of unleashing the potentialities that altered perspectives may reveal". This kind of reading of data (especially, but not necessarily, through digital manipulation), does not happen very much at all in archaeology. If 'deformance' is a key sign of the digital humanities, then digital archaeologists are not digital humanists. Trevor's point isn't to signal who's in or who's out, but rather to draw attention to the fact that: 

> When we separate out the the context of discovery and exploration from the context of justification we end up clarifying the terms of our conversation. There is a huge difference between “here is an interesting way of thinking about this” and “This evidence supports this claim.”

This, I think, is important in the wider conversation concerning how we evaluate digital scholarship. We've used computers in archaeology for decades to try to justify or otherwise connect our leaps of logic and faith, spanning the gap between our data and the stories we'd like to tell. A digital archaeology that sat within the digital humanities would worry less about that, and concentrate more on discovery and generation, of 'interesting way[s] of thinking about this'. In [a paper on Roman social networks and the hinterland of the city of Rome](http://www.academia.edu/598317/The_Space_Between_The_Geography_of_Social_Networks_in_the_Tiber_Valley_in_Coarelli_F._and_Patterson_H._eds_Mercator_Placidissimus_the_Tiber_Valley_in_Antiquity._New_research_in_the_upper_and_middle_river_valley._Proceedings_of_the_Conference_held_at_the_British_School_at_Rome_27-28_Feb._2004_._Rome._British_School_at_Rome_-_Edizioni_QVASAR), I once argued (long before I'd ever heard the term _digital humanities_) that we should stop using GIS displaying North at the top of the map, that this was hindering our ability to see patterns in our data. I turned the map sideways - and it sent a murmur through the conference room as east-west patterns, previously not apparent, became evident. This, I suppose, is an example of deformation. Hey! I'm a digital humanist! But other digital work that I've been doing does not fall under this rubric of 'deformation'. My [Travellersim simulation](http://www.academia.edu/598312/TravellerSim_Growing_Settlement_Structures_and_Territories_with_Agent-Based_Modeling_full_text) for instance uses agent based modeling to generate territories, and predict likely interaction spheres, from distributions of survey data. In essence, I'm not exploring but trying to argue that the model accounts for patterns in the data. This is more in line with what digital archaeology often does.

In a post on [archaeological glitch art](http://mediterraneanworld.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/archaeological-glitch-art/) Bill has been changing file extensions to fiddle about in the insides of images of archaeological maps, then looking at them again as images: 

> "The idea of these last three images is to combine computer code and human codes to transform our computer mediate image of archaeological reality in unpredictable ways. The process is remarkably similar to analyzing the site via the GIS where we take the “natural” landscape and transform it into a series of symbols, lines, and text. By manipulating the code that produces these images in both random and patterned ways, we manipulate the meaning of the image and the way in which these images communicate information to the viewer. We problematize the process and manifestation of mediating between the experienced landscape and its representation as archaeological data."

In the same way, Trevor[ uses augmented reality smartphone translation app](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/02/deforming-reality-with-word-lens/)s set to translate Spanish text into English, but pointed at non Spanish texts. It's a bit like Mark Sample's _[Hacking the Accident_,](http://hacking.fugitivetexts.net/) where he uses an automatic dictionary substitution scheme (n+7, a favorite of the Oulipo group) to throw up interesting juxtapositions. A deformative digital archaeology could follow these examples. Accordingly, here's my latest experiment along these lines. [caption id="attachment_1616" align="alignleft" width="300"]![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/amphorae-imitation.png?w=300) Screen shot from the deformed Netlogo 'Mimicry' model[/caption] Let's say we're interested in the evolution of amphorae types in the Greco-Roman world. Let's go to the Netlogo models library, and instead of building the 'perfect' archaeological model, let's select one of their evolutionary models - Wilensky's '[Mimicry](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Mimicry)' model, which is about the evolution of Monarch and Viceroy butterflies swapping in 'amphora' for 'moth' everywhere in the code and supporting documentation, and 'Greeks' for 'birds'. In the original model code, we are told: 

> "Batesian mimicry is an evolutionary relationship in which a harmless species (the mimic) has evolved so that it looks very similar to a completely different species that isn’t harmless (the model). A classic example of Batesian mimicry is the similar appearance of monarch butterfly and viceroy moths. Monarchs and viceroys are unrelated species that are both colored similarly — bright orange with black patterns. Their colorations are so similar, in fact, that the two species are virtually indistinguishable from one another.

## Comments

**[wuzzy](#9608 "2013-02-26 09:34:51"):** Is there an online image of the sideways map that surprised your conference attendees? I didn't see one in the paper you linked to and would love to see an example of how a rotation of the coordinate system can give rise to inferences otherwise blocked. Thanks.
