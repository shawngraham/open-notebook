# Interactive Fiction - bibliography and other directions

[Denis Jerz](http://jerz.setonhill.edu/) writes of IF,  "Interactive fiction requires the **text-analysis **skills of a literary scholar and the relentless **puzzle-solving** drive of a computer hacker. People tend to love it or hate it. Those who hate it sometimes say it makes them think too much" I like IF. I'm crap at solving puzzles, but I like it all the same. For the bibliophiles amongst us, some bibliography from the academic literature on Interactive Fiction - you'll note that most of the academic interest in IF waxed and waned in the late 80s, early 90s. But, there has been a resurgence in interest lately, mostly due to the literary qualities of IF. If that's the sort of thing that interests you, check out: Douglass, J. (2007). Command Lines: Aesthetics and Technique in Interactive Fiction and New Media. Dissertation, U. California Santa Barbara. [link](http://jeremydouglass.com/dissertation.html) as well as the complete oeuvre of [Nick Montfort](http://nickm.com/if/), including his '[Twisty Little Passages](http://nickm.com/twisty/)'. Nick also has a '[harcover](http://nickm.com/if/winchester.html)' of an IF he created, for sale:

![](http://nickm.com/if/wn_hardback.jpg) An annotated bibliography of academic IF, published in 2002, [lives here](http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/bibliography/academe.htm). Emily Short's articles on the art of creating IF may be [found here](http://emshort.wordpress.com/writing-if/my-articles/). If you're at all interested in the possibilities of creating IF, you must start with Short's work! Finally, a blog worth following for the literary qualities of IF and other species of computer-mediated writing: [Grand Text Auto](http://grandtextauto.org/) 'A group blog about computer narrative, games, poetry, and art' Right.
