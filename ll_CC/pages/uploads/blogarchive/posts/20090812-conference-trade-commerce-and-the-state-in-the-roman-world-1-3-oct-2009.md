# Conference: Trade, Commerce, and the State in the Roman World, 1-3 Oct 2009

As I don't expect I'll be in Oxford any time soon :( , maybe somebody could take notes on William Harris' presentation on the timber trade in the Roman world? Many thanks! I've been interested in that trade for a while - it is woefully underexplored - and I have some thoughts on it coming out in the Cambridge Companion to the City of Rome (due out soon, I believe!), but these are mostly cursory. I'm imagining someone like Harris probably has some very interesting things to say...
