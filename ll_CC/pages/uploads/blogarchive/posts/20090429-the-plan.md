# The Plan

I'm moving up in the world. The plan is to join the department of faculty training and development at [Grand Canyon University](http://www.gcu.edu/) in Arizona as a faculty specialist - putting all my online nous to work, helping other faculty make their online classes successful. Hooray! Also, [Rob MacDougall](http://www.robmacdougall.org/index.php/2009/04/how-ill-spend-my-summer-vacation/#more-359) writes: 

> [Bill Turkel](http://history.uwo.ca/faculty/turkel/) and I, along with Brock University’s [Kevin Kee](http://kevinkee.ca/) and some great collaborators, have been awarded a generous grant for a project entitled “History at Play: Augmented Reality Gaming and the Ubiquitous Past.” The grant comes from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) as part of their Image, Text, Sound, and Technology (ITST) initiative. Basically, we will be using games and gaming models to teach some Canadian and American history and to promote public heritage sites. I’d love to say more about the cool stuff we are planning, but I am mindful of Bill’s injunction to [at least cut a demo before posing with a guitar](http://www.robmacdougall.org/index.php/2009/02/digital-history-hacks/). So this summer we’ll be cutting our demo. I’ve sometimes been reluctant to cross the streams of my history day job and my gaming hobby, but I feel like this is a project I was built to do.

I'm pleased to say that I'm one of the collaborators, and this project should be a lot of fun. Of course, consider the source: anything, after stamped bricks up the yin-yang, would be lots of fun.
