# Edufraggin'

Seems some folks at Drexel University have adapted the Unreal Tournament for teaching Chemistry, Physics and English. From the screen-shots, etc, seems like an intense flash-card type of exercise, but I'll have to download their stuff and see what it's like. Might be very appropriate for teaching/learning ancient languages... Anyway, you can see their stuff at <http://edufrag.blogspot.com/> and at <http://edufrag.wikispaces.com/>
