# Forum Novum: a market in the Sabine Hills - scenario for Caesar IV

This is my first attempt at a scenario for Caesar IV. It is based, loosely, on the site of Forum Novum in the Sabine Hills north of Rome. What I have always found fascinating about this site is the way it didn't develop into what we would recognise as a 'town', per se.![forum-novum-08-02-25-21-26-33.jpg](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/forum-novum-08-02-25-21-26-33.jpg) A student playing this scenario as part of a class on Roman urbanism would try to reach the 'winning conditions', but would be encouraged to look at the underlying assumptions the game makes about social, civil, economic, and religious life. Specifically, by using the game as a kind of Roman socio-economics simulation engine, the student is forced through game play to confront the Roman economy... It's late right now, so I'll write more about how the game would be used in a class, and what playing it might teach. In the meanwhile, you can download the scenario here into your 'data' -> 'scenarios' folder for Caesar IV. No doubt there are bugs and other problems that need to be worked out, so let me know how you get on... (by the way - the game puts an 'apron' around the scenario for aesthetics... but the one I chose doesn't really fit, as you can see when you follow the Aia river by the town towards the edges... the painting tool in the scenario editor is absolutely _abysmal_!) 

  * **postscript**: I discovered that my scenario had a bug in it that caused catastrophic crashing of the game. So I'm rejigging it, and I've posted over at [Titled Mill Forums](http://www.tiltedmill.com/forums/showthread.php?p=183983#post183983) asking for help... which I duly received. The 'production version' is available [here](http://www.tiltedmill.com/forums/showthread.php?p=184079#post184079), as will be any future updates.
