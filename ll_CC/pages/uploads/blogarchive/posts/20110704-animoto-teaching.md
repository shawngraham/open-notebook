# Animoto & teaching

I'm thinking of creating short video clips to introduce different modules & segments for my courses next fall. [Animoto's ](http://animoto.com/)free offerings would seem to do the trick. I built the following, from odds and sods lying around my computer, as a trailer for one class, just to see how animoto works: [youtube=http://youtu.be/tJ7pY26de38] Pretty simple. Select your background. Upload your images. Select some music. Hey presto, you're done. Most of those images are public domain, though I can't for the life of my find the source for the 'Dark [Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance)' dancers (see the work of [Terry Pratchett](http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/AntiMorris/pratchett.shtml); I reference Discworld often in my lectures. Just can't stop myself.) If it's your image or you know where it comes from, I'd love to give proper attribution for it.
