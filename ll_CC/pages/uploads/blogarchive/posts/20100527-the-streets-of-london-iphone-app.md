# The Streets of London - iphone app

> Have you seen the old man In the closed-down market Kicking up the paper, with his worn out shoes? In his eyes you see no pride And held loosely at his side Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news So how can you tell me you're lonely, And say for you that the sun don't shine? Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London I'll show you something to make you change your mind -[Ralph McTell](http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/mctell-ralph/streets-of-london-11077.html)

[The Museum of London](http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/) \- always at the forefront in museology & archaeology - [has released an iPhone app ](http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/MuseumOfLondon/Resources/app/you-are-here-app/index.html)that transforms your experience of the streets of London into an augmented reality.  If only: a) I had an iPhone and b) I was in London. I look forward to seeing more of these sorts of things emerge. Imagine - mashing the physical, the digital, the past, and the present all at once.  Landscape archaeology as palimpsest is a fairly standard idea, but these sorts of applications should only enhance the notion more popularly [he said, hopefully...] ![](http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/images/4/2010/05/500x_historiclondon_01.jpg)

This alpine setting is very different, but it fits in well with local tourism in the form of hikers, mountainbikers and off-piste skiers. http://www.viarch.org.uk/content/research-summaries-detail.asp?ProjectID=27 http://hazelnutrelations.wordpress.com/2010/02/25/ruckwege-archaeology-silvretta-via/
