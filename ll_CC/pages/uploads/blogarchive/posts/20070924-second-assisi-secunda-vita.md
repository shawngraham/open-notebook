# Second Assisi & Secunda Vita

I wrote before about Vassar's version of the Sistine Chapel in Second Life... today I came across [SecundaVita](http://secundavita.wordpress.com/), a blog and associated website about the construction of a Second Life version of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. The simulation looks fantastic, and recreates much more of the context and setting of the Basilica than does the Vassar Sistine Chapel. I especially like the image below taken during the build of the Basilica. Note the ground plan! I could imagine taking some archaeology students into a sim in Second Life, where the ground plan of an archaeological site is presented to them for their reconstruction... ![](http://www.secundavita.com/images/blog/costruzione_sl_assisi_planimetrie.jpg)
