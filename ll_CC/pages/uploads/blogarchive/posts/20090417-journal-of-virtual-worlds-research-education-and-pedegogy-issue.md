# Journal of Virtual Worlds Research: Education and Pedegogy Issue

[There's a new issue of the JVWR out](http://www.jvwresearch.org/v2n1.html), well worth a look-see: Summary: 

> [This edition of the Journal of Virtual Worlds Research](http://http://www.jvwresearch.org/v2n1.html) is dedicated to exploring the breadth of designs, pedagogies and curricular innovations that are actually already being applied to teaching and learning in virtual worlds. We encourage participation from a broad range of academics, researchers, educators, and educational practitioners from across the disciplinary spectrum â€“ including, but not limited to: curriculum development, educational administration, distance education, information and knowledge management, instructional technology, e-learning, communication and education, sociology, art education, and visual culture. We strongly encourage submissions that illustrate key findings with examples and case studies; experimental research; pedagogical innovations; and best practices for the integration of virtual worlds technologies into the learning experience.
