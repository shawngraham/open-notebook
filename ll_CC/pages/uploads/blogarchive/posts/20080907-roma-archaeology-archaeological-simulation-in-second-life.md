# Roma Archaeology: Archaeological simulation in Second Life

Scott Moore reports at [Ancient History Ramblings](http://ancienthistory.typepad.com/ancient_history_ramblings/2008/08/sl-archaeology.html) on a new sim in SL that does an excellent job of demonstrating the ins and outs of archaeology. I'd go take a look at it myself, but the lag on satellite internet makes that pretty much impossible. If you go, send me a postcard. [Here're directions](http://world.secondlife.com/place/b825a434-6465-9b76-e8fd-233c8a5bb837). ![](http://secondlife.com/app/image/90d4ad02-8c48-da23-c26e-1aa51d959929/1)
