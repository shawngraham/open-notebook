# Call for Papers: Chicago Digital Humanities

In my inbox this morning, a notice of what looks like a fantastic opportunity: 

> [Call for Papers: 3rd Annual Chicago Digital Humanities/Computer Science Colloquium](http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/dhcs2008/draft-2008-call-for-papers/) DHCS Colloquium, November 1st - 3rd, 2008 Submission Deadline: August 31st, 2008 The goal of the annual Chicago Digital Humanities/Computer Science (DHCS) Colloquium is to bring together researchers and scholars in the Humanities and Computer Sciences to examine the current state of Digital Humanities as a field of intellectual inquiry and to identify and explore new directions and perspectives for future research. In 2006, the first DHCS Colloquium examined the challenges and opportunities posed by the “million books” digitization projects. The second DHCS Colloquium in 2007 focused on searching and querying as both tools and methodologies. The theme of the third Chicago DHCS Colloquium is “Making Sense” – an exploration of how meaning is created and apprehended at the transition of the digital and the analog. We encourage submissions from scholars and researchers on all topics that intersect current theory and practice in the Humanities and Computer Science. Sponsored by the Humanities Division, the Computation Institute, NSIT Academic Technologies and the University Library at the University of Chicago, Northwestern University and the College of Science and Letters at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
