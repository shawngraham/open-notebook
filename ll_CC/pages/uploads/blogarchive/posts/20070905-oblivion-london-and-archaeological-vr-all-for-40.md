# Oblivion, London, and Archaeological VR: All for $50!

In an earlier post, I mentioned the [Rome Reborn](http://www.romereborn.virginia.edu/) project, and some criticisms of it: namely, that it was too antiseptic, and it was lacking people. An alternative approach being used by the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/) at UCL is to employ game engines instead - see [this article at The Escapist Magazine](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_109/1331-London-in-Oblivion). So, download your free copy of [SketchUp,](http://www.sketchup.com/) buy a $50 game from your local mall, and you're ready to create immersive, first-person environments for building your archaeological VR: no more movies to watch, but spaces to explore! Here is the [blog ](http://www.digitalurban.blogspot.com/)from the CASA folks, and I believe I once heard mention from some archaeologists at one of the Computer Applications in Archaeology conferences of a similar approach. The CASA people though provide you with [step-by-step instructions](http://digitalurban.blogspot.com/2007/06/tutorial-importing-sketchup3d-max-into.html). Here is one of their final videos showing the process:[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FW-uCnuSxY] From The Escapist: 

> [...] Much of today's practice of architecture, then, is 3-D modeling. Sites like [CGArchitect](http://www.cgarchitect.com/default.asp) ("The Global Community for Architectural Visualization Professionals") show how the profession is becoming, not a subsidiary, but a component specialty of digital visualization, the sprawling, hyperactive industry that encompasses manufacturing, illustration, special effects, animation and, incidentally, computer games. You'd think this would encourage a marriage of architecture and gaming. In comparison to game engines, architectural packages need heavy hardware, aren't optimized for real-time walkthroughs, and cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. As the Fallingwater map shows, a good game engine can achieve many effects seen in the high-end packages, in real time. It also brings bonuses like weather effects, and it costs $50 or less. [...] [...] To recreate historic battles, the BBC documentary series _[Time Commanders_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386245/) (2003) and The History Channel's _[Decisive Battles_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421095/) (2004) both used a retuned [Rome: Total War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome:_Total_War) engine. (Don't confuse the shows' tweaked engine with _Rome_'s most popular mod, _[Total Realism_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Total_Realism).) The History Channel also used _[Brothers in Arms_](http://www.brothersinarmsgame.com/index.php) for World War II battle scenes in its eponymous [2005 documentary](http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=74810&browseCategoryId=&location=&parentcatid=&subcatid=).

> Likewise, some architects and designers are using conventional visualization software to reconstruct archaeological sites. For instance, sponsored by the Colgate University (NY) Department of Anthropology and Sociology, the Honduran Ministry of Culture and a slew of government agencies, freelance digital designer Clement Valla is [visualizing the ruined Mayan city of Copan](http://www.cgarchitect.com/news/Reviews/Review056_1.asp). Valla scans hand-drawn plans into the high-end 3-D modeling package [Rhinoceros](http://www.rhino3d.com/) ($995) and photos into [PhotoModeler](http://www.photomodeler.com/index.htm) photogrammetry software ($995). In this area, game engines could play strong. A gamer could quickly work up buildings in SketchUp, then texture and light them in _Oblivion_ or Source. Leaving aside research time, a full-featured tour of Copan - or the Great Pyramids, or Pompeii - could require little more effort than a good _Counter-Strike_ map. You could run it on mid-range desktop hardware, with non-player characters in period dress as your tour guides. And hey, if you don't like the guides, you can blow them away with grenades! Match that, Honduran Ministry of Culture! Another possibility: in-engine city guides. After seeing City 17 in _Half-Life 2_, you can easily imagine a similar map of, say, Amsterdam. [Planet PSP](http://www.gamespot.com/psp/puzzle/planetpsp/index.html?q=Planet%20PSP) already publishes PlayStation PSP travel guides for several European cities, but game-engine guides could actually show you the place. If you could turn on in-engine, user-defined data layers, as in _Google Earth_, text bubbles would appear as you wander the virtual streets, offering tourist info, restaurant reviews, slides and video clips.

Oh, and here is the video showing how to go from Sketchup into Oblivion: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlV3z7_7UFQ]
