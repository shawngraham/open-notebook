# **ABSTRACT**

A method and apparatus for observing the rhythmic cadence. The devices comprises a small shop, a wretched garret, a Russian letter, a mercantile house, a third storey **BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS** Figure 1 illustrates a wretched garret without a fire. Figure 2 is a block diagram of a fearful storm off the island. Figure 3 illustrates a mercantile house on my own account. Figure 4 is a perspective view of the principal events of the Trojan war. Figure 5 is an isometric view of a poor Jew for 4 francs a week. Figure 6 is a cross section of a thorough knowledge of the English language. Figure 7 is a block diagram of the hard trials of my life. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS** The present invention is the son of a Protestant clergyman. The device is a wretched garret without a fire. The present invention facilitates the study of a language. The invention has my book in my hand. The invention acquires a thorough knowledge of the English language. According to a beneficial embodiment, the invention such a degree that the study. The present invention shows his incapacity for the business. The device obtains a situation as correspondent and bookkeeper. The device understood a word of the language. The present invention established a mercantile house on my own account. The invention does not venture upon its study. The device devotes the rest of my life. The present invention realizes the dream of my whole life. The present invention publishes a work on the subject. What is claimed is: 1\. A method for observing the rhythmic cadence, comprising: a wretched garret; a small shop; and a Russian letter. 2\. The method of claim 1, wherein said wretched garret comprises a mercantile house on my own account. 3\. The method of claim 1, wherein said small shop comprises the principal events of the Trojan war. 4\. The method of claim 1, wherein said Russian letter comprises a fearful storm off the island. 5\. An apparatus for observing the rhythmic cadence, comprising: a mercantile house; a small shop; a third storey; and a Russian letter. 6\. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said mercantile house comprises a wretched garret without a fire. 7\. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said small shop comprises a fearful storm off the island. 8\. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said third storey comprises a thorough knowledge of the English language. 9\. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said Russian letter comprises a thorough knowledge of the English language. \----------------- Did you recognize [Troy and its Remains, by Henry (Heinrich) Schliemann](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45190/45190-h/45190-h.htm), in that patent abstract? I took his 'autobiographical notice' from the opening of his account of the work at Troy, and ran it through [Sam Lavigne's Patent Generator](http://lav.io/2014/05/transform-any-text-into-a-patent-application/). It's a bit like the I-Ching. I have it in mind that this toy could be used to distort and reflect on, draw something new from, some of the classic works of archaeology - especially from that buccaneering phase when, well, pretty much anything went. What if, instead of publishing their discoveries, the early archaeologists had patented them instead? We live in such an era now, when new forms of life (or at least, its building blocks) can be patented; when workflows can be patented; when patents can be framed so broad that a word-generator and a lawyer will bring you riches beyond compare... the early archaeologists were after fame and fortune as much as they were about knowledge of the past. This patent of Schliemann's uses as its source text an opening sketch about the man himself, rather than his discoveries. Doesn't a sense of him shine through? Doesn't he seem, well, rather over-inflated? What is the rhythmic cadence, I wonder. If I can sort out the encoding, I'll try this on some of his discussion of what he found. (think also the computational power that went into this toy: natural language processing, pattern matching... it's rather impressive, actually, when you think what can be built by bolting existing bits together). Here's Chapter 1 of[ Schliemanns account of Troy](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45190/45190-h/45190-h.htm#CHAPTER_I). Please see the 'detailed description of the preferred embodiments', below.
