# Remembrance Day

The [Royal Canadian Mint](http://www.mint.ca/poppy/poppy-landing.html) has produced an excellent video, as part of this year's Poppy Campaign. What is particularly striking about this video is that they've appropriated a point-of-view more commonly found in an FPS-type video game. We often talk, as educators, about the power of immersive learning from video games, and I think this video is a brilliant example of that power. By using the visual and aural strategies of an FPS, they bring the horror and futility of WWI to a new audience, in a language to which they are already accustomed. For those of us not raised on video games, it hits all the stronger, since our notions of that conflict are created from books or third-person perspective movies.
