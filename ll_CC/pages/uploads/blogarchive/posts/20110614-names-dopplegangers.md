# Names & Dopplegangers

Just got a phone call from a friend, who was interested in my opinion piece in the Ottawa Citizen, mentioned on the radio. Problem is, I wrote no opinion piece. Turns out, there's a PhD student in the History Department at the University of Ottawa (just down the Canal), who shares my name, and who is the[ author of the piece](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/story_print.html?id=4940900&sponsor=) (it's a good article). So, just to forestall any confusion: [Sean Graham at the University of Ottawa](http://www.history.uottawa.ca/plan.html) is not [Shawn Graham at Carleton University](http://www1.carleton.ca/history/faculty-and-staff/1631-2/).
