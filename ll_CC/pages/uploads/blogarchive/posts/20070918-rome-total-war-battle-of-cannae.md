# Rome Total War: Battle of Cannae

I love machinima that people create - Where would they be without [Carl Orff and Carmina Burana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Orff)? But this piece is rather nicely done. Imagine if you had some tech-savvy students... wouldn't something like the piece below be more entertaining to grade than another essay? Question is, what grade would this piece get? And on what would you mark it? I feel a [rubric](http://www.teach-nology.com/web_tools/rubrics/general/) coming on... [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyNoHvfkUc4]
