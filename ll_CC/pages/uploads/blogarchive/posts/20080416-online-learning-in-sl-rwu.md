# Online learning in SL & RWU

Here's a short video clip I made mostly to figure out how to do it. It shows a one-on-one tutorial going on inside Second Life, at [RWU](http://www.robertwelchuniversity.org)'s virtual campus. The last section of the film features a field trip to Catal Hoyuk, as reconstructed by the ['Remixing Catalhoyuk](http://okapi.dreamhosters.com/remixing/mainpage.html)' team at Okapi Island. Where else but in Second Life can you begin with a language tutorial, move on to intro to archaeology, and finish up by exploring an ancient settlement, while sitting in your slippers drinking coffee?

I should've liked to have only gotten the window, but I couldn't get rid of the toolbars on the bottom. Then I used Windows Movie Maker to make the title, credits, and transitions. The resulting file was enormous. I thought I had to transform it into FLV format (from AVI) before uploading it to youtube, so I spent some useless hours looking for decent converter software (my definition of decent: "free"!). I didn't want to buy fraps, but apparently its the best screen capture software out there - the demo version didn't do me any good whatsoever. Anyway, turns out you can upload avi to youtube, and they do the conversion. Who knew?!
