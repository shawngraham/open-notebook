# Ancient World Mapping Center

I was pleased to discover that the [Ancient World Mapping Center](http://www.unc.edu/awmc/index.html) has picked up my paper from the Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 19.1 (2006) 25-64. The abstract from that paper is [here](http://www.unc.edu/awmc/grahamjma.html), and some of my agent based models can be found over at my [postdoc](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~grahams) pages at the University of Manitoba.
