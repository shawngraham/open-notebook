# Platial and Pleiades - rss feeds

I've become a beta-tester on [Platial](http://platial.com). The RSS feed tool seems to work better on the testing side of the site, although it is still somewhat quirky. The screenshot shows what you get once you submit a feed - in this case, the atom geo-referenced feed from the [Pleiades ](http://pleiades.stoa.org/)Project. Now, what I would've expected, is that Platial automatically extracted the geographic coordinates for each item in the feed, and mapped it. That's not what happens - rather, the Platial tool is expecting that you've added a feed that doesn't contain geographic info (say, a list of church suppers in your area), and then you punch in the address, city, state, or lat/long coordinates. Now, that is indeed a handy tool for non-georeferenced feeds, but defeats my purpose. At least for today. I've also tried using automatic feed generators for third party sites, things like [Feedity ](http://www.feedity.com/)on [Archaeology ](http://www.archaeology.org/)magazine's [archaeological news page](http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/index.html) with Platial, and with Yahoo Pipes. I'd like to see where in the world things are happening! To date, not much success (Feedity tosses in advertisements which - I'm guessing - cause problems). I suppose were I handy with coding etc I could make it all work... but again, that'd be defeating the purpose. ![platialpic.JPG](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/platialpic.thumbnail.JPG)
