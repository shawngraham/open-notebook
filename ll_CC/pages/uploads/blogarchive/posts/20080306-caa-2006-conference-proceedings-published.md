# CAA 2006 conference proceedings published

Ah! Just had a note in my email that the conference proceedings from the Computer Applications in Archaeology conference 2006, which was held in Fargo, has now been published. Full bibliographic notice: Jeffrey T. Clark and Emily M. Hagemeister, Editors. 2007. _Digital Discovery: Exploring New Frontiers in Human Heritage. CAA 2006. Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology. Proceedings of the 34th Conference, Fargo, United States, April 2006_.Budapest:`Archaeolingua. (ISBN 978-963-8046-90-1) The TravellerSim paper in that volume, about using agent modeling for growing social networks from regional site distribution data, was written by me with the development help of [James Steiner](http://www.turtlezero.com/), and presented at that conference. And now, happily, the paper and the code are published! My thanks to Jeffrey Clark on a big job well done.
