# Virtual Excavation in Second Life Has Found a New Home

My thanks to Colleen Morgan, who has found a lovely corner of Anteater Island, an island in SL associated with the AAA/American Anthropologist and[ ](http://www.lib.uci.edu/online/second_life/)[UC Irvine](http://www.lib.uci.edu/online/second_life/), for me to re-establish my virtual excavation. I hope to have it up and running within the next month, at which point I'll give the exactÂ  slurl and invite feedback and criticism.  Thank you very much Colleen!
