# Powerpointed Out? Try Flypaper Instead.

I enjoy a good Powerpoint presentation. I really do. I love the cadences as presenters turn to read the slide, and then turn back to the audience, and then back to the slide... it reminds me of oscillating fans on a hot summer day... This post is not a rant about powerpoint (but you should check out _[The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint_](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_pp), Edward Tufte).Â  It is to direct you to something new, [Flypaper](http://www.flypaper.net). I'm to give a presentation at a conference in a month's time; think I'll try this out and see if it makes for better visuals to accompany the presentation (presentation is on 'e-learning', so I'm using lots of multimedia, game clips, Second Life movies, etc). It couldn't hurt. I think.
