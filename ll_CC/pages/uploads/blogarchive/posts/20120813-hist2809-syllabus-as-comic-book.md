# HIST2809 Syllabus as Comic Book

In the hopes that a more visually appealing syllabus will mean that my students read the thing, I'm turning the first few pages of the HIST2809 syllabus into a comic book. The nuts-and-bolts will be the regular format.(The doctored historical plaques are from Rob MacDougall's '[Tecumseh Lies Here](http://www.playthepast.org/?p=1609)' augmented reality game). Oh, and the final project/exam is a version of [the Forgery Game](http://www.playthepast.org/?p=1495). ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/page_1.jpg?w=231) ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/page_2.jpg?w=231) ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/page_3.jpg?w=231) ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/page_4.jpg?w=231)

**[Kristina Killgrove (@DrKillgrove)](#7188 "2012-08-13 16:49:05"):** Aw yeah, I found Comic Life. Intro to BioAnth just got comic-ified. Can't decide if I'll stick with it, though...

**[Jessica](#7229 "2012-08-30 03:39:07"):** This is great! A wonderful example of digital history, haha. I stumbled across this blog because of the course I'm taking on digital history...I'm going to have to suggest this to my professor...

**[Kristina Killgrove (@DrKillgrove)](#7186 "2012-08-13 13:51:33"):** Very cool! I'm currently in the middle of redesigning my syllabus. It's going to be more brochure/flyer than comics... 'though maybe I'll steal this idea for the intro course I'm teaching. :)
