# Bristol Light Cider, from Coronation Hall Cider Mills

'Bristol Light Cider' 5.5% al/vol - a product of [the Pontiac, Quebec](http://www.mrcpontiac.qc.ca/index_e.htm)! It took 20 months, but our family cider mill finally received permission from the provincial government to make, and sell our hard cider! It's entirely possible to get permission to make cider, but not to sell it... I love officialdom. When you live in your head as much as the typical academic does, there's something enormously satisfying in making something with your hands *and* your head. We haven't made the official announcement yet, but I was quite excited, hence this post :) [Coronation Hall Cider Mills](http://www.coronationhall.com)
