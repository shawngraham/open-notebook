# -ing history! 

Still playing with videogrep. I downloaded 25 heritage minute commercials (non-Canadians: a series of 1 minute or so clips that teach us Canucks about the morally uplifting things we've done in the past, things we've invented, bad-things-we-did-but-we've-patched-over-now. You get the gist.). I ran them through various pattern matches based on parts-of-speech tagging. It was hard to do anything more than that because the closed captioning (on which this all rests) was simply awful. Anyway, there's a healthy dose of serendipity in all of this, as even after the search is done, the exact sequence the clips are reassembled in is more or less random. And with that, I give you the result of my pattern matching for gerunds: _-ing history! A Heritage Minute Auto-Supercut._ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3X_GE3684
