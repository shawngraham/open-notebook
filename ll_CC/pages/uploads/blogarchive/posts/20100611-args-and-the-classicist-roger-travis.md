# ARGs and the Classicist: Roger Travis

[Roger Travis](http://livingepic.blogspot.com/) is doing amazing things in his classics classes.  He creates immersive learning experiences, and often his tools are low-tech, or old-tech, like interactive fiction (which I think doesn't get enough respect in terms of digital learning!) 

> In [Operation KTHMA](http://livingepic.blogspot.com/2009/09/operation-kthma-post-hub.html), the course on Herodotus and Thucydides, my students stood trial for breaking and entering the home of Pericles' rival Thucydides son of Melesias. In [FABULA AMORIS ROMANI](http://livingepic.blogspot.com/2010/01/pedagogical-practomime.html), my students had to sing for Augustus, first emperor of Rome. In these moments, fun is being had—I have video of some of these moments, and there are actual smiles on my students' faces!—but fun isn't the thing that matters most. What matters is engagement in the material, and, if they're to be believed in their comments on the course at the end of the semester, my students were engaged. In [(Gaming) Homer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ODsYS_q8k), my students are caught up in an ARG where they must become homeric bards by observing and playing _The Lord of the Rings Online_ in relation to the _Iliad _and the _Odyssey_.

His latest looks fantastic: 

> The Demiurge recruits the students as operatives in Project ΑΡΧΑΙΑ in the usual way (cryptic e-mails on the course's web-site saying that their services have been commandeered to save Western Civilization yada yada yada). In order to reach the mission objectives of knowledge  and skill necessary to brief the world about Greek cvilization (including sub-objectives of reading ancient Greek), the Demiurge has coded the following practomimetic simulation into the TSTT: It's the lead-up to the trial of Socrates, and operatives are inserted into Athenians who could be called on to be jurors. In order to make the best possible decision about his guilt and his penalty, they must learn everything they can about how Socrates ended up on trial (which is, when told correctly, a story that goes back to the Bronze Age), and what the consequences of the trial have been for Western Civilization.
