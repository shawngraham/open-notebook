# Networked Corpus Index

I found this today: [http://www.networkedcorpus.com Â ](http://www.networkedcorpus.com)for visualizing the results of MALLET topic models, by reference to exemplary passages. Its creators explicitly contrast this with index building by hand... more about all that later; here's how to get it working for you. See the documentation at <https://github.com/jeffbinder/networkedcorpus> Install python 2.7, numpy, and scipy. Download the installers, and follow the instructions. Then download the networked corpus zip file, and unzip it somewhere on your machine. In the networked-corpus folder, there is a subfolder called 'res' and a script called gen-networked-corpus.py. Move these two items to your Mallet folder. Generate a topic model as you would normally do, from the command line. Then, type at the command prompt: `gen-networked-corpus.py --input-dir <the folder with your original texts in it> \--output-dir <the name of a folder you'd like all the output to be in>` Navigate to that folder in your browser, open the index.html and voila.
