# On Caesar IV and the Ancient Economy

Having spent a great deal of time in [my thesis ](http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=185482751&ETOC=RN&from=searchengine)pondering (amongst other things) the mysteries of Roman economics, it is curious to see how a city-builder game like Caesar IV demands many of the same skills - working with cost ratios, determining how much of a particular resource certain kinds of activities consume, distance & profit calculations - see for instance the discussion [here ](http://www.tiltedmill.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13141)and the tables [here](http://caesar4.heavengames.com/gameinfo/articles/production). Then go and study something like [The Baths of Caracalla](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1998/1998-11-41.html) by [Janet DeLaine](http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/resources/staff_directory/janet_delaine). It is all strangely similar. I would have done better to have spent a few months playing the game and _then_ looking at my copy of [Finley ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Finley)or [Hopkins](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/2003-06-32.html). I'm not saying that the assumptions that underlie the game mechanics are analogous to the actual workings of the Roman economy; I'm saying that the game foregrounds the interconnectedness of production, consumption, taxes and society, which in my opinion is extremely important when working with the archaeology. Imagine a seminar on the ancient economy where the aim is to mod Caesar IV (or similar) to reflect [the latest thinking](http://www.stanford.edu/~scheidel/Companion.pdf) on the ancient economy, and then playing it out... I am constantly running out of money & resources as I play the game, which brings a whole new appreciation to the problems of monetary supply...
