# Google Goggles: Augmented Reality

![Google Goggles translating on the fly](http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/goggles_translation.png)Time was, if you wanted some augmented reality, you had to upload your own points of interest into something like Wikitude or Layar. However, in its quest for world domination, Google seems to be working on something that will render those services moot: [Google Goggles](http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#text) (silly name, profound implications). As Leonard Low says on the MLearning Blog: 

> The official Google site for the project (which is still in development) provides a number of ways Goggles can be used to accomplish a “visual search”, including landmarks, books, contact information, artwork, places, logos, and even wine labels (which I anticipate could go much further, to cover product packaging more broadly). So why is this a significant development for m-learning? Because this innovation will enable learners to “explore” the physical world without assuming any prior knowledge. If you know absolutely nothing about an object, Goggles will provide you with a start. Here’s an example: you’re studying industrial design, and you happen to spot a rather nicely-designed chair. However, there’s no information on the chair about who designed it. How do you find out some information about the chair, which you’d like to note as an influence in your own designs? A textual search is useless, but a visual search would allow you to take a photo of the chair and let Google’s servers offer some suggestions about who might have manufactured, designed, or sold it. Ditto unusual insects, species of tree, graphic designs, sculptures, or whatever you might happen to by interested in learning. Just watch this space. I think Google Goggles is going to rock m-learning…

Now imagine this in action with an archaeological site, and google connects you with something less than what we as archaeological professionals would like to see.  Say it was some sort of aboriginal site with profound cultural significance - but the site it connects with argues for the opposite. Another argument for archaeologists and historians to ['create signal' and to tell Google what's important](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/why-academic-blogging-matters/).

**[Dig Girl](#3711 "2010-10-04 21:36:11"):** Thanks for sharing! This is a great point you bring up as Google is still assuming that everything on the internet is truthful or factual and therefore, whatever your results are will be the "correct" answer.
