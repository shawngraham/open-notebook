# VUE + OpenContext.org: quickly visualizing relationships in data

Archaeology is about context, about understanding relationships, about looking at the spaces between datapoints, as much as it is about the points themselves. I've been experimenting with [VUE](http://vue.tufts.edu/index.cfm), mostly as a way of organizing my Zotero libraries, and to help in the planning of a digital history course I really would like to teach next year. So far, it's been great. But this morning, while watching some of the how-to videos, I started thinking about how VUE could be used to represent archaeological data. Here's the video: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgfgfi6X6u8] So: import data from an RSS feed, along with its metadata.... Hmmm. I tried it with the atom feed from [OpenContext.org](http://opencontext.org), regarding the[ Presidio of San Francisco feed](http://opencontext.org/sets/facets/United+States/California/Presidio+of+San+Francisco.atom?proj=Presidio+of+San+Francisco). I've goofed it a bit - missed an important step - but I think there's real potential here... further bulletins as events warrant; I've got a couple of training sessions to lead, so I'm off to class.

I'm looking forward to learning what could be done, and what needs to added or changed about the Open Context feeds. If a you want a feed with some much more elaborate metadata, this may be interesting: http://opencontext.org/projects/.atom Looking forward to hearing more! -Eric
