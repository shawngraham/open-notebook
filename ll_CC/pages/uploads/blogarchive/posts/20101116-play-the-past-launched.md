# Play the Past launched!

I'm happy to report that [Play the Past](http://www.playthepast.org/), a collaboratively edited & authored blog about cultural heritage and games, has launched. Actually, [Ethan](http://www.captainprimate.com/), our intrepid leader, says it best: 

> At its core, _Play the Past_ is a collaboratively edited and authored blog dedicated to thoughtfully exploring and discussing the intersection of cultural heritage (very broadly defined) and games/meaningful play (equally broadly defined). _Play the Past_ contributors come from a wide variety of backgrounds, domains, perspectives, and motivations (for being interested in both games _and_ cultural heritage) – a fact which is evident in the variety of topics we tackle in our posts.It is very important to note that _Play the Past_ isn’t just about _digital _games, its also about non-digital games (boardgames, tabletop games, collectible card games, etc.), alternate reality games (ARGs), barely games (a term originally coined by [Russel Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2009/11/playful.html) – no, not the _Doctor Who_ Russel Davies – and built upon by our very own [Rob MacDougall](http://www.robmacdougall.org/blog/2010/05/pastplay/)), and playful mechanics (or “gamifying” as its been recently called). We are also very interested in exploring the spectrum of approaches to games – from the more “philosophical” (as some might call it) games studies side of things, to the more practically applied serious games/meaningful play side of things (and just about everything betwixt and between).

Drop by and see what's happening!
