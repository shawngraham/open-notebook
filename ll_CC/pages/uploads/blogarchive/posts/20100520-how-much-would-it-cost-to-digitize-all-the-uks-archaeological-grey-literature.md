# How much would it cost to digitize all the UK's archaeological grey literature?

I am a member of the [Working Group on Open Archaeology](http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/archaeology). Recently in the discussion, Anthony Beck linked to  a recent presentation of his called 'Dig the new breed: how open approaches can empower archaeologists': [slideshare id=3805787&doc=arbokcconpresentation240410-100421122142-phpapp02] In one of his slides, he mentions [Richard Bradley](http://www.reading.ac.uk/archaeology/about/staff/r-j-bradley.aspx), from my alma mater, the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/), and how Richard used the grey literature from various commercial bodies to write his [history of bronze age Britain](http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521612708&amp;ss=fro). He links to [this article](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100407/full/464826a.html). As I was reading this, it occurred to me that here is a perfect opportunity for crowdsourcing... perhaps. What would it cost to digitize all of the UK's grey literature?[ Here are the plans for a $20 DIY book scanner](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/04/cheap_portable_book_scanner_instruc.html) which uses a basic point-and-shoot digital camera.  And here is an [open source optical character recognition package](http://code.google.com/p/ocropus/) from the good people at Google. So only two hurdles remain: getting access to the grey literature, and the man-power to do this (hence the crowdsourcing). It would be interesting perhaps for a phd student to try this out at their local archaeological consultancy, and then perhaps use some data mining techniques (like in [this example](http://historying.org/2010/04/01/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/)) to quickly begin to extract useful information. The technology is there... let's make it work!

**[Mike Heyworth](#3281 "2010-05-20 16:53:47"):** But what about OASIS (http://www.oasis.ac.uk/) which already has over 5000 grey literature archaeology reports available online to download for free?!

**[myfreecams hack](#11037 "2013-11-12 16:44:59"):** It's going to be end of mine day, however before end I am reading this enormous post to improve my experience.
