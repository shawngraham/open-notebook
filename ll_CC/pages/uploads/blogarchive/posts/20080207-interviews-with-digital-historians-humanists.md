# Interviews with Digital Historians & Humanists

I was a participant at the [First Digital Workshop held at the Centre for Digital Humanities, University of Nebraska Lincoln](http://cdrh.unl.edu/opportunities/neb_digital_workshop/index.php) in the fall of 2006. I had forgotten that [I - and others - had been interviewed for our thoughts on the Digital Humanities:](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews.html) what they were, what they were for, where the field was going, etc. So imagine my surprise when I found the video clips of those interviews today! My clips are here: ![](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/images/bullet2.jpg)[The definition of "digital history" or "digital humanities" ](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews/grahamint1.html) ![](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/images/bullet2.jpg)[His initial encounters with digital scholarship in the humanities ](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews/grahamint2.html) ![](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/images/bullet2.jpg)[The atmosphere surrounding or reception of digital scholarship in the academy ](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews/grahamint3.html) ![](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/images/bullet2.jpg)[Audiences for or community involvement with digital scholarship ](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews/grahamint4.html) ![](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/images/bullet2.jpg)[The potential for "humanities in the digital age"](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/interviews/grahamint5.html) It's a bit odd to watch oneself on video for the first time... I remember I was caught somewhat by surprise, so you can see the little wheels exploding in my head, as I try to sound reasonably intelligent. The people you should really listen to are:
