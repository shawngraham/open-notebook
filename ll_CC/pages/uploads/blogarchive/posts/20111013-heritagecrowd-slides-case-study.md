# HeritageCrowd - slides, case study

Guy Massie and I recently gave a talk at the Carleton University Art Gallery on what we learned this past summer in our attempt to crowdsource local cultural heritage knowledge & memories. With the third member of our happy team, Nadine Feuerherm, we wrote a case study and have submitted it to '[Writing History in the Digital Age](http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/crowdsourcing/heritagecrowd-project-graham-massie-feuerherm/)'. This born-digital volume is currently in its open peer-review phase, so we invite your comments on our work there. Below are the slides from our talk. Enjoy!
