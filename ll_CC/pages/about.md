## This Notebook

This notebook represents the final stage in a Scrivener to Github workflow (with side trips to Dillinger.io) that I wrote about on [Electric Archaeology](http://electricarchaeology.ca).

This wiki is markdown driven. It's a nice layer for viewing my markdown notes. The documentation for this [MDwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md) says to put the md files anywhere else but github, but grudgingly says, 'well, if you must...' There's probably good reasons for that, but I've only been playing with this for a day so it all remains to be seen. Sure, dropbox would be elegant, but without the 'public' folder [functionality it wouldn't be viewable](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!tutorials/dropbox.md).


## Why open?

The rationale for an open notebook (especially for historians, archaeologists!) is nicely covered by Caleb McDaniels in [Open Notebook History](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html).

## So... you've got stuff here then?

Well, not yet. I've spent a lot of time figuring out my workflow. Now, I've got to get cracking!
