# Artefacts as Nodes in a Network

I'm working on a paper for a conference next month. In it, I consider artefact copresence at various sites as a means for generating networks, in an effort to get at some of the ideological or social frameworks underpinning the distribution of these networks. I'm looking at stamped brick from Constantinople. I create a list where each entry is a site and a single example of a stamped brick. These I can then visualize using Gephi, and using Sci2 I can convert the two mode network (brick - place) to two one mode networks (bricks - bricks, tied because they're found at the same place; place - place, tied because they use the same bricks). When I have this data as 1-mode networks, I can then run network stats. Below is the one mode graph, showing places tied to other places, based on the distribution of over 2300 stamped bricks: ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/constantinople-brickstamps.png?w=300)
