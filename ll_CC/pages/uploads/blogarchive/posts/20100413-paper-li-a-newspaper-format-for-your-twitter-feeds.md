# Paper.li - A newspaper format for your twitter feeds

Twitter is useful. It keeps you connected. But it's a pain to read. [Paper.li](http:///paper.li) is a new service, still in alpha no less, that takes all of your feeds, searches, groups, tweets, etc, and analyzes them once a day to create a newspaper-style presentation. Videos referenced in a tweet? Paper.li will present them to you. Photos, media... it's all there. I quite like this! Here's the [Electric Archaeologist Today](http://paper.li/electricarchaeo) ![](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/mypaper.jpg?w=300) So - if you created a twitter account and used it not so much for your own tweeting, but rather to aggregate the twitterverse for say all things archaeological, museological, politics & archaeology etc... you'd have a daily publication with the latest from the 'real-time' web. As soon as I get this marking done, that's what I'm going to do. Look out [Digital Humanities Now](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/)! :)
