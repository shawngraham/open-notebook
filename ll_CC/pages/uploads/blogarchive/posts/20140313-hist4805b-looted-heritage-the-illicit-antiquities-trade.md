# HIST4805b Looted Heritage: The Illicit Antiquities Trade

I'm teaching a fourth year seminar next year dealing with issues surrounding the illicit antiquities trade. This seminar will be in conjunction with a larger project spearheaded by the investigative reporter and author Jason Felch, of _[Chasing Aphrodite_](http://chasingaphrodite.com/). I'm quite excited about this; as an undergraduate, I once had the opportunity to work on a term project that looked at the antiquities market. That was twenty years ago; I've never really had the opportunity to scratch that itch since. So, when I was asked to suggest a seminar topic, I jumped at the chance to plumb the depths of my own ignorance together with my students. What better way to teach than to be learning right along with your students? As ever, I turned to twitter, to see what folks there had to say.

> re that last tweet, I meant to add: open to suggestions! — Shawn Graham (@electricarchaeo) [March 12, 2014](https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo/statuses/443799344643186689)

Many folks chimed in with suggestions, including:

I'm keeping all of these in a zotero library for eventual sharing with my students (wider world too), but for now, this is the kind of stuff that's come in: Legal & Academic Frameworks Renfrew, Colin. _Loot, Legitimacy and Ownership: The Ethical Crisis in Archaeology_.

Assessment In terms of assessment, I want to avoid long research essays based on secondary sources. Instead, I'd rather have the students build something, analyze something, visualize something... so this will be a heavily digital humanities inflected course. I want my students at the coalface. My little looted heritage social media observatory, <https://heritage.crowdmap.com/> will be pulled out of the mothballs and will become an active part of the course. We'll be mining eBay, looking at the auction sites, exploring museum archives... probably. Stay tuned! If you have suggestions for things the students should be reading/looking at/exploring, please do drop me a line or leave a comment.
