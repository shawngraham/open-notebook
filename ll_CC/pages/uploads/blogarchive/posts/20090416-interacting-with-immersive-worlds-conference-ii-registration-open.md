# Interacting with Immersive Worlds Conference II - registration open

The second edition of Brock's Interacting with Immersive Worlds Conference is taking place this summer. Registration is now open. I was able to attend last year, and it was the highlight of my conference season. Unfortunately I won't be able to attend this year, so I'm going to miss out on some brilliant sessions.
