# It would've been nice

It would've been nice if the IT folks at U Manitoba had given me some warning that they were about to close my account. I'm no longer going to be teaching for them in the fall, it is true; but a lot of my stuff - not to mention my agent models - are on their servers. My own fault, I guess - I should've cleaned everything off of there when I decided to decline the fall courses, but still, it would've been nice to have had some warning. So, if you're looking for me @umanitoba.ca, that doesn't work any more. I'll be getting some new contact info before too much longer, and hopefully, some space for my simulations, too.
