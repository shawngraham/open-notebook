# Kickstarter: funding your project

An interesting platform for obtaining funds for your project is at[ Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/). Say you're a local community history group, and you have a great idea for a project using [Omeka ](http://omeka.org/)to showcase some fascinating aspect of your region, but you need funds to hire someone to set it up for you. That kind of microproject probably wouldn't attract the regular funding sources... but maybe the people browsing the projects on Kickstarter can help.Â  On Kickstarter, you describe your project. People pledge funds. If you get enough pledges to reach your target, the money is sent to you. Seems to me it might be an interesting way of funding and promoting local archaeological projects to. Search ['history' in their current list of projects](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/search?term=history), and you'll find projects such as:
