# Blogging Archaeology

[William Caraher](http://mediterraneanworld.typepad.com/about.html) has been writing about the [history of blogging, especially in the archaeological world](http://mediterraneanworld.typepad.com/the_archaeology_of_the_me/2007/12/blogging-arch-1.html) (it is also posted [here](http://ancientworldbloggers.blogspot.com/2007/12/blogging-archaeology.html)). It's a fascinating discussion, and it brought to my attention a number of blogs - and student blogs written whilst on-site at excavations - that I hadn't encountered before. It was nice, too, to see Electric Archaeology get a mention amongst all this fantastic work - thanks! Many people write blogs with the hope of making a bit of coin from them too somehow. I wonder if academic blogs are considered in awarding tenure? I reach more people writing this blog than a lot of my more *academic* writing. My thesis isn't climbing the ranks of Amazon, that's for sure! From the original post: 

> "...These specialized blogs will not be of interest to everyone, but they have tapped into the rich potential of digital media to communicate, inspire, and promote collaborative scholarship. Shawn Graham’s innovative [Electric Archaeologist ](http://electricarchaeologist.wordpress.com//)shows how a whole range of digital media can assist an archaeologist in research and teaching. Sebastian Heath’s blog [Mediterranean Ceramics](http://mediterraneanceramics.blogspot.com/) explores the intersection of the study of Mediterranean ceramics and the resources available on the internet. Tom Elliot, the director of the [Pleiades Project](http://www.unc.edu/awmc/pleiades.html) which brings together geographic and historical information for ancient places across the Mediterranean, makes occasional posts at his [horothesia](http://horothesia.blogspot.com/) blog. His main interest is developing innovative and open methods to disseminate archaeological and historical data. Scott Moore’s [Ancient History Ramblings](http://www.ancienthistory.typepad.com/ancient_history_ramblings/) has developed a serious focus on archaeology in the virtual world of Second Life. [Charles Watkinson](http://www.charleswatkinson.com/), the director of publications at the American School of Classical Studies maintains an occasional blog on “communication in the humanities and social sciences.” [Digging Digitially](http://www.alexandriaarchive.org/blog/) provides some great info on digital archaeology as the “Semi-offical” news source for the SAA’s Digital Data Interest Group. The [Okapi Project’s blog ](http://okapi.wordpress.com/blog/)from the University of California at Berkeley includes regular reports on their innovative efforts to disseminate academic research through digital media – including their work with the Çatalhöyük excavations...."
