# Caesar IV

....ah christmas morn. Opening the new toys... and a copy of Caesar IV! Can't wait to get into it... it has a 'sandbox' mode, allowing you to disregard all the preset scenarios and to build your own. I'm going to build me an Ostia, and a Pompeii, and see what emerges out of the simulation. I've done some city simulations with Netlogo (see the [agent based modeling page](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/%7Egrahams)) where I've built the interactions from scratch. William Urrichio argues that games embody different epistemologies, so I'll be interested to see how the game designers envision ancient life... and to compare against my own simulations. Theirs of course is much more aesthetically pleasing than my wee netlogo creations, but all of them have value...
