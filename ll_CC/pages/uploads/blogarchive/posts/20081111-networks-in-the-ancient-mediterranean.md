# Networks in the Ancient Mediterranean

Not that I was googling myself, but I discovered that some of my work had been cited approvingly in the preface to an issue of the [Mediterranean Historical Review](http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/cmc/mhr/mhr.html) (and [here for online access](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t713636259~db=all)), (2007, vol 22 n1) on social networks analysis in terms of ancient history. The entire issue looks absolutely fantastic, and I'm now working my way through it. This might be a great place for a grad student to start, if they're interested in social networks applied to historical problems. (Another good starting place is definitely the [Handbook of Prosopography ](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Prosopography-Approaches-Applications-Prosopographica-Genealogica/dp/1900934124)edited by Katherine Keats-Rohan).
