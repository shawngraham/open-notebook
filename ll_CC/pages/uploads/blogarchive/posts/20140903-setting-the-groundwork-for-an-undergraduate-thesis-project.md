# Setting the groundwork for an undergraduate thesis project

We have a course code, HIST4910, for students doing their undergraduate thesis project. This project can take the form of an essay, it can be a digital project, it could be code, it could be in the form of any of the manifold ways digital history/humanities research is communicated. [Hollis Peirce](http://hollispeirce.grahamresearchfellow.org/) will be working with me this year on his HIST4910, which for now is called 'The Evolution of the Digitization of History: Making History Accessible'. Hollis has been to DHSI twice now, once to take courses on digitization, once to work on the history of the book. Hollis' [interest in accessibility ](http://hollispeirce.grahamresearchfellow.org/about/) (as distinct from 'open access', which is an entirely different kettle of fish) makes this an exciting project, I think. If you're interested in this subject, let us know! We'd like to make connections. We met today to figure out how to get this project running, and I realized, it would be handy to have a set of guidelines for getting started. We don't seem to have anything like this around the department, so Hollis and I cobbled some together. I figured other folks might be interested in that, so [here they are](https://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/gettingstartedthesisguidelines.pdf).
