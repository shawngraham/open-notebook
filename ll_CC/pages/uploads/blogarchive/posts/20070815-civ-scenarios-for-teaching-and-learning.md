# Civ scenarios for teaching and learning

At Robert Welch University, I've gotten the green light to start designing a history class aimed at gamers. I want to make scenario building in Civilization IV (and maybe Caesar IV) one of my main formative assessment exercises. Over at [Civfanatics](http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=237984), I've asked that community what they think of the idea...
