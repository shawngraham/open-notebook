# TweetMapping Archaeology

At [OUseful, Tony Hirs](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/simple-embeddable-twitter-map-mashup/)t shows how one can take a search feed from Twitter, and run it through Yahoo Pipes, to produce a map showing who is tweeting about a particular subject & where. This might be useful, indeed. So I cloned the pipe, and banged in 'archaeology' OR 'archeology', and made a copy of it available [here. ](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=05ea61fd00d6a974089b16503061a59e) I should have included 'archaeology' in other languages, but that's easy enough to do in the search box. ![tweetmap](http://electricarchaeologist.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/tweetmap.jpg)

It's easy enough to do in a pipe too, using the Translate block eg here's a demo pipe that searches in English, Spanish, Russian and French given an English search term http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=UOLeaeEE3hGmfvCYrbQIDg
