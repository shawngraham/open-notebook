# When on Google Earth: now in its 21st iteration

The [21st iteration of When on Google Earth](http://sjmcdonough.blogspot.com/2009/04/when-on-google-earth-21.html) has just been successfully won by [Chuck Jones](http://www.blogger.com/profile/12882192031767315365) \- again! The range of periods covered by the game has been quite catholic so far - everything from the modern day to the deepest past, demonstrating the range of interests in archaeology today. To all of you who have hosted an iteration of the game, what kind of meta information is it generating? Who's been visiting? How many? Who's been linking to it? Does this game have any impact in terms of public archaeology? Below are my stats for the first post: 862 views total, 342 of those in 2009 4 on average per day in 2009 Hmm. My wordpress stat tools don't really allow me to get the information I'm looking for. A google search of "when on google earth" returns 3790 pages. Full history of When On Google Earth:
