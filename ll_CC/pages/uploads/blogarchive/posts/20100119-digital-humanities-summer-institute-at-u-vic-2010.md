# Digital Humanities Summer Institute at U Vic 2010

The offerings at the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://www.dhsi.org/) at the University of Victoria (BC) are quite interesting this year - though I note nothing on Agent Modelling.Â  If I was in that neck of the woods, I'd be quite keen to take the following - 

> #### Geographical Information Systems in the Digital Humanities
> 
> _Ian Gregory_The course offers an introduction to the theory and practice of using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to research the past. It will be primarily based on using the ArcGIS software package, the use of Google Earth to disseminate humanities data will also be explored. The course will be relevant to historians, historical geographers, demographers, and others with an interest in the geographies of the past. Quantitative and qualitative approaches will both be explored. We would welcome attendees bringing their own data so that we can explore how to get it into GIS form and what can then be done with it.

There are [scholarships ](http://www.dhsi.org/home/scholarships)and some other limited financial aide available.
