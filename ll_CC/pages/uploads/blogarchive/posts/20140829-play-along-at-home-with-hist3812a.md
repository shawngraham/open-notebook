# Play along at home with #hist3812a

In my video games and history class, I assign each week one or two major pieces that I want everyone to read. Each week, a subset of the class has to attempt a 'challenge', which involves reading a bit more, reflecting, and devising a way of making their argument - a procedural rhetoric - via a game engine (in this case, [Twine](twinery.org)). Later on, they'll be building in Minecraft. Right now, we have nearly 50 students enrolled. If you're interested in following along at home, here are the first few challenges. These are the actual prompts cut-n-pasted out of our LMS. Give 'em a try if you'd like, upload to [philome.la](http://www.philome.la/), and let us know! Ours will be at [hist3812a.dhcworks.ca](http://hist3812a.dhcworks.ca) I haven't done this before, so it'll be interesting to see what happens next. **Introduction to #hist3812a** **Challenge #1** **Read:**

  1. Fogu, Claudio. 'Digitalizing Historical Consciousness', _History and Theory _2, 2009.
  2. Tufekci, Zeynep. 'What Happens to #Ferguson Affects Ferguson: Net Neutrality, Algorithmic Filtering and Ferguson. _Medium_August 14 2014
**Craft:** A basic Twine that highlights the ways the two articles are connected. **Share:** Put your Twine build (the *html file) into the 'public' folder in your Dropbox account (if you don't have a public folder, just right-click and select public link - [see this help file](https://www.dropbox.com/help/16)). Share the link on our course blog:

**Critical Play Week** **Challenge # 4** **Remember: ** Keep notes on the discussions from the critical play session; move around the class, talk with people about what they're playing, why they're making the moves they're doing, and think about the connections with the major reading. _(nb, I've assigned all the students to bring in video games, board games, in both sessions this week that we'll play. We might decamp to the game lab in the library to make this work. This group will observe the play. I've also pointed them to [Feminist Frequency](http://www.feministfrequency.com/) as an example of the kind of criticism I want them to emulate)._ **Craft:** Devise a Twine that captures the dynamic and discussions of this week's in-class critical play. Remember, for historians, it may be all about time and space. **Share:** Put your Twine build (the *html file) into the 'public' folder in your Dropbox account.
