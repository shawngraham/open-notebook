# Civilization & Education

In the course of doing some writing on why making games and modifications for existing games is a much better educational endeavour than simply playing historically-themed games (it seemed much more clever when expressed in 7000 words than 20), I came across the [following post on Rob MacDougall's blog ](http://www.robmacdougall.org/index.php/2007/07/madness-and-civilization-iii/)which covers some of what I'm thinking: 

> In simpler language, _Civilization_’s game play erases its own historical content. Learning to play means learning to ignore all the stuff that makes it a game about history and not about, say, fighting aliens. One could easily program a different game with a different set of ideological assumptions—Galloway imagines a “People’s _Civilization_” game by Howard Zinn—and see precisely the same de-historicizing effect. Mastering the simulation game necessarily involves a journey away from reality towards abstraction, away from history towards code.

However, I don't know whether there's anything particularly unique to computer games about that idea - isn't any game, when you really get down to it, about mastering the mechanics of the game, the rules? (whether or not those rules are expressed mathematically or in a rule-book is immaterial I should think). Anyway, there's a lot more on his blog worth a longer look! Ultimately, MacDougall concludes that what one should do is get the students to design their own game. We've been doing just that at the [Simulating History](http://simulatinghistory.com) project at Brock for some time; we've got a workable beta up and running, but man! there's a lot of work involved. My role in that project (making the game) is more of a background reviewer-type guy; I'm not at the coalface. Yet.
