# Interface, NETSCI09, and MHR

Oh, if I but had the coin to go to conferences... (I'll tattoo your logo where'er you want: corporate sponsorship?) Two conferences appearing on the networks and archaeology mailing list this morning: 

> [InterFace ](http://www.interface09.org.uk/)is a new type of annual event. Part conference, part workshop, part networking opportunity, it will bring together postdocs, early career academics and postgraduate researchers from the fields of Information Technology and the Humanities in order to foster cutting-edge collaboration. As well as having a focus on Digital Humanities, it will also be an important forum for Humanities contributions to Computer Science. The event will furthermore provide a permanent web presence for communication between delegates both during, and following, the conference. Delegate numbers are limited to 80 (half representing each sector) and all participants willbe expected to present a poster or a 'lightning talk' (a two minute presentation) as a stimulus for discussion and networking sessions. Delegates can also expect to receive illuminating keynote talks from world-leading experts, presentations on successful interdisciplinary projects, 'Insider's Guides' and workshops. The registration fee for the two day event is Â£30. For a full overview of the event, please visit the website.

And, on the premise that great conferences always take place in fanatastic locations, [NETSCI09](http://www.netsci09.net/) this year is in Venice: 

> The aim of NETSCI is to bring together leading researchers, practitioners, and teachers in network science to foster interdisciplinary communication and collaboration.

They have a subsection on network science and humanities, which I'd love to attend. On a related note, a paper of mine has been accepted for publication with [Digital Studies](http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies), on re-animating the brick production networks of first and second century Rome -a proxy for patronage networks- with an ABM that generates civil violence: a theory of civil strife through malfunctioning patronage. And finally, a book of interest: 

## [Greek and Roman Networks in the Mediterranean](http://www.routledge.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=&isbn=9780415459891)

> How useful is the concept of "network" for historical studies and the ancient world in particular? Using theoretical models of social network analysis, this book illuminates aspects of the economic, social, religious, and political history of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. Bringing together some of the most active and prominent researchers in ancient history, this book moves beyond political institutions, ethnic, and geographical boundaries in order to observe the ancient Mediterranean through a perspective of network interaction. It employs a wide range of approaches, and to examine relationships and interactions among various social entities in the Mediterranean. Chronologically, the book extends from the early Iron Age to the late Antique world, covering the Mediterranean between Antioch in the east to Massalia (Marseilles) in the west. This book was published as two special issues in _Mediterranean Historical Review_.

I've skimmed through the original special issues, and - I'm happy to be wrong - it seemed to me that 'networks' were being used more as a metaphor than an actual theory with methodological implications, as used by such people like [Barabasi](http://www.nd.edu/~alb/). (and now I'll get some angry emails... ;)

## Comments

**[Guido Caldarelli](#2182 "2009-07-20 07:58:02"):** Hi, thanks for such nice comments on our conference I am personally interested in cross boundary research, the Nethum part of the conference was a bit smaller with respect to the rest, but I hope it will grow in time (next year it will be probably in Korea) . As for the results presented, we are working to put on line all the slides. it will take time, but I hope we will finish the web site soon. :) All the best Guido
