# Playing History: Your Source for Historical Games

Just came across the '[playing history](http://playinghistory.org)' website which, interestingly, is powered by [Omeka](http://omeka.org/). There is a wealth of resources here. Many are actually based in Canada. The [Montreal Museum of Archaeology](www.pacmuseum.qc.ca) is one prominent developer of historical games based on Montreal's history. There are many ancient-themed games listed too. A search on 'Rome' provides:

**[Ella Rogers](#2691 "2010-03-02 05:51:16"):** I have been meaning to tell you about a new maths resource that is one of my new favourite links, Mangahigh.com. Although the site is new, it has a lot to offer and new maths games are being added frequently. I have been using it in the classroom and for homework. A great teacher’s resource they have put together is a lesson plan guide: http://www.mangahigh.com/ Cheers!
