# The PDQ - a new journal bridging blogging and academia

The PDQ is rapidly shaping up to be something quite exciting. A [first call for papers may be found here](http://archaeoporn.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/past-discussed-call-for-papers/), and [the official PDQ website is being built here](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/). If you've got something of interest to say regarding the past, why not take this opportunity?![](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/files/2008/02/pdq-link.jpg) From the official website: "[PDQ is a journal](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/) designed to provide a bridge between blogging and academia. It will provide stable citeable references for selected weblog posts focussed upon or of interest to the pre-Renaissance past. It is compiled from articles submitted by bloggers on a quarterly basis. [The journal is available in three formats.](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/list-of-editions/) There is a PDF downloadable copy for free. There is a paper copy which can be ordered via Lulu, which is set to the cost of printing and delivery only. Finally we intend that the journal will also be placed in a repository for long-term curation. Until the details are finalised it will be available in XHTML format from a server based at NYU’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. PDQ is released under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND licence, making it freely copyable. We are looking for [submissions](http://pdqweb.edublogs.org/how-to-submit-an-article/) on any medieval / ancient / prehistoric topics from bloggers which fall into the categories below. Additionally each edition has a theme which we welcome submissions from historians and archaeologists of any period to contribute to. See the Calls for Papers for forthcoming topics. Submission deadlines are the ends of February, May, August, November."

This is the real link: http://slipperybannanapeel.blogspot.com/ I work in a new media section of a newspaper and one idea I've been working on is a link up between del.icio.us bookmarketing and into a clean well organised web magazine frontpage like the NY TImes, the Economist, that provides a virtual publication in the manner of the Huffington Post. There are a lot of more marginal corners of history (e.g. Mon history, conference in October, in Bangkok) that could possibly join up with or gain energy and sophistication through association with more mature disciplines like the classical Greek or Roman history. Many productivity enhancing tools will push blogs past conventional publishing as a platform. For instance, as I was writing this, I wanted to place links to exemplify everything I said. Unfortunately, time does not permit. Thanks again.

**[colleenmorgan](#407 "2008-02-18 12:45:09"):** Hey, cool! Thanks for the heads-up about the journal. There are so many great things going on right now that it's hard to keep up.

**[jonfernquest](#411 "2008-02-21 07:07:25"):** Thanks. I found this via "tag surfer" at Wordpress which has to be rated a great tool for interdisciplinary collaboration. I've used blogs to write five papers on early modern Burmese history (c. 1350-1600) and the issue has come up of the legitimacy of blogging and academic writing at the Australian National University blog New Mandala that specialises in Southeast Asia. [[link](http://rspas.anu.edu.au/rmap/newmandala/2007/11/28/interview-with-professor-michael-aung-thwin/)] I used the blog in writing drafts and published the final copies in an online journal with rigorous (perhaps even too rigorous) citation practices and yet people still confused the draft with the finished product. I kind of gave up the practice but seeing this, remotivates me. Thanks. Since I work as a full time journalist and only do history in my spare time, blogs are great for getting focus and the peer review aspect, well that is superb if it can be brought into the blog.
