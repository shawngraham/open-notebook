# The Game's the Thing

I'm headed of to the Niagara peninsula next month, for **[Playing With Technology in History**](http://www.playingwithhistory.com/). Here's what I thought I'd talk about : 

> **Shawn Graham, “Rolling your own: On Modding Commercial Games for Educational Goals”[ ](../)** Making modifications to existing commercial games is a strong and vibrant sub-culture in modern video gaming. Many publishers now provide tools to make this easier, as part of their marketing strategy. In this paper, I look at the nature and quality of the discussions that occur on the fan mod sites as a form of participatory history. I also reflect on some of my own forays into modding commercial games in my teaching of ancient history: what works, what hasn’t, and where I want to take things next.

I'm looking at a lot of the literature on online learning right now, about how to assess the educational value of formal discussion fora (usually in the context of learning management systems), but I'm thinking it's equally applicable to the fansites. Hmmm. Kevin's also asked me to take everyone through the process of developing a mod or scenario in Civilization, ideally having something built at the end of the day. Again I say, hmmm. It'll be fun, but I need to think how best to do that in a useful way that says something interesting and intelligent about history. Here's Rob's thoughts about [the same conference](http://www.robmacdougall.org/index.php/2010/03/survival-of-the-funnest/) and the idea that the 'funnest' narrative is going to be the one that wins. Civilization as a game is certainly about crafting narratives through play. I need to dust off my copy of Civ. With one thing or another (including a small fire in the power supply of my computer yesterday!) I haven't had a solid block of time to play/craft in what feels like ages.
